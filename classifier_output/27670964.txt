Biodegradable polydioxanone stent as a new treatment strategy for tracheal stenosis in a rabbit model.
Congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) is a rare condition and difficult to treat. Slide tracheoplasty has unsatisfactory outcomes for severe neonatal symptomatic CTS. This study evaluated the use of biodegradable polydioxanone stents (BD stent) in a rabbit model of CTS. Tracheal stenosis was induced in female Japanese white rabbits, 9-10weeks old, by direct scraping of the tracheal mucosa with a nylon brush following transverse incision of the trachea (control group, n=4). Seven days later, we incised the trachea again and inserted a BD stent (15Ã—5mm) into the trachea (stent group, n=4). Arterial blood gas analysis was performed twice weekly for 1month after the procedure. In the control group, respiratory acidosis arising from ventilatory failure was observed on postoperative days 7-10. Rabbits were sacrificed at 11.5days after scraping. Severe tracheal stenosis resulting from inflammatory granulation was detected in the scraped region in all rabbits. In the stent group, arterial blood gas analysis was normal at 28days after stent insertion. The BD stent maintained patency of the tracheal lumen and prolonged survival for 1month. The use of BD stent represents a promising new treatment method for tracheal stenosis.
