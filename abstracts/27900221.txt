Grafted tubularised incised-plate urethroplasty: An objective assessment of outcome with lessons learnt from surgical experience with 263 cases.
Snodgrass urethroplasty remains the preferred technique in primary distal hypospadias but development of meatal stenosis often limits distal extension of the midline incision of the urethral plate (MIUP), which remains a limiting factor in reconstructing an apical neomeatus (NM). We here-in assess the cosmetic and functional outcome with distal extension of the MIUP in grafted tubularised incised-plate urethroplasty (G-TIP) repair. This prospective study included the surgical experience of 263 cases of primary hypospadias operated upon between 2012 and 2015. The G-TIP technique included standard steps of Snodgrass urethroplasty, including degloving and harvesting of glans wings, followed by MIUP that was extended distally beyond the margins of the urethral plate (UP) into the glans. The incised bed was grafted with a free preputial skin graft and fixed to the bed with polydioxanone 7-0 suture. The UP was tubularised and the suture line reinforced with a Dartos flap. The urethral catheter was removed at 7-10Â days after the repair and the outcome was assessed at follow-up using the Hypospadias Objective Scoring Evaluation (HOSE) system. An apical NM was achieved in 96% of the patients with a 3.7% incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. The presence of suture tracks and graft at the margins of the NM were seen in the initial 4% and 5% of cases, respectively. Acceptable cosmetic results, with objective HOSE scores of >14, were achieved in 96% of cases. The G-TIP repair is a straightforward and feasible technique facilitating reconstruction of an apical NM, with an optimum outcome based on HOSE scoring. However, multicentre data are needed for undertaking comparative analysis and to assess the universal applicability of this technique in primary hypospadias.
