The effect of indwelling catheter on OH-proline in the urethral wound: an experimental study.
To investigate the effect of catheterization on urethral wound healing by measuring OH-proline. Eighteen male New Zealand albino rabbits were divided equally into three groups. In the control group, urethral tissue samples were taken from the ventral penile surface. In group II, the ventral penile surface was incised and primarily repaired by 6/0 polydioxanone. In group III, the incised urethra was repaired by 6/0 polydioxanone and a urethral catheter was inserted. Tissue samples were taken on the 20th postoperative day in groups II and III. Tissue OH-proline levels were measured by the method of Bergman and Loxley. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used for evaluation. OH-proline values as microg/mg dry tissue were 16.43+/-2.68 in the control group, 14.47+/-1.82 in group II and 14.63+/-0.63 in group III. There was no significant difference between the three groups (P>0.05). Use of a urethral catheter does not appear to have a direct effect on collagen synthesis in wound healing.
