Antibacterial [corrected] coating of abdominal closure sutures and wound infection.
Poor wound healing and the development of infection in incisional wounds continue to be among the most common complications of open abdominal surgery. Various bacteria may contaminate not only the tissue in the operative wound, but also the actual suture material. To prevent the contamination of suture material in surgical wounds, triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 suture materials with antibacterial activity (Vicryl plus) was developed. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the use of Vicryl plus reduced the number of wound infections after midline laparotomy comparing to polydioxanon suture (PDS II). We performed 2,088 operations in our department between October 2004 and September 2006 via midline incision. In the first time period (TP1), a PDS II loop suture was used. In the second time period (TP2), we used Vicryl plus. All variables were recorded prospectively in a database. The primary outcome was the number of wound infections. Risk factors for poor wound healing were collected prospectively to compare the 2 groups. Using a PDS loop suture for abdominal wall closure in TP1, 10.8% of patients with wound infections were detected. The number of patients with wound infections decreased in TP2 using Vicryl plus for abdominal wall closure to 4.9% (P < .001) despite no other changes in protocols of patient care. Other risk factors for the development of site infections were comparable in the 2 groups. The use of antibiotic-coated loop suture for abdominal wall closure can decrease the number wound infections after abdominal surgery.
