Biocompatibility and adhesion formation of different endoloop ligatures in securing the base of the appendix.
The common technique used in securing the base of the appendix is Endoloop ligature (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). Vicryl (polyglactin 910) (Ethicon) and polydioxanone (PDS) (Ethicon) Endoloop ligatures can be used. There are potential benefits of the use of PDS Plus (Ethicon) Endoloop ligature. However, the use of different materials may vary in terms of inflammation, foreign-body reaction, rate of infection in the surgical area, or rate of adhesion formation. An ideal suture would induce minimal inflammatory response and adhesion formation. Ninety rats were randomized into 3 groups: group I, in which appendectomy was performed with Vicryl ligature; group II, in which appendectomy was performed with PDS ligature; and group III, in which appendectomy was performed with PDS Plus ligature. The animals were killed on the seventh, 28th, and 60th days after surgery. The secured stump was used for histopathologic and immunohistochemistry analysis, as well as evaluation of the formation of adhesions. Mild and moderate inflammation was more frequent in the PDS and PDS Plus groups than in the Vicryl group on the seventh postoperative day. There were no significant differences in the degree of inflammation on the 28th and 60th postoperative days. The lowest degree of postoperative adhesions was observed in the PDS group. Milder postoperative inflammatory changes and a lower degree of postoperative adhesions were seen in the PDS ligature group, suggesting that this could be the standard Endoloop used to secure the base of the appendix.
