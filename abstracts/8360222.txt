Kinetics of cell proliferation as a function of vascular graft material.
Bioresorbable vascular grafts constructed for polyglactin 910 (PG910) and polydioxanone (PDS) and nonresorbable Dacron were interposed into the infrarenal abdominal aortas of New Zealand White rabbits. The prosthesis/tissue complexes were harvested after 2, 3, 4, 12, and 52 weeks. Seventeen, 9, and 1 h prior to sacrifice, animals received tritiated thymidine (0.5 mCi/kg/dose). All specimens were studied grossly and by light and transmission electron microscopy. Mitotic indices (MI's) were determined by autoradiography for inner capsule myofibroblasts at the proximal, mid, and distal segments of each prosthesis. There were no aortic-related deaths. All grafts were patent with no aneurysmal dilatation. At 4 weeks, PG910 resorption was evidenced by macrophage phagocytosis, less so in PDS while Dacron remained intact. At 12 weeks, the PG910 was completely resorbed while PDS resorption continued. The latter was completely resorbed by 52 weeks. There was no significant difference in MI's between proximal, mid, and distal regions for each graft type. The mitotic index paralleled the rate of prosthetic resorption in both PG910 and PDS groups, as high as 28.34 +/- 23.21 in the former 3 weeks after implantation and significantly higher at 4 weeks (7.58 +/- 2.02 and 7.50 +/- 2.66, respectively) than at 52 weeks (0.72 +/- 0.98 and 1.00 +/- 0.22, respectively) in both groups. The mitotic index in the Dacron group never surpassed 1.22 +/- 0.90. We conclude that higher levels of early cell proliferation in bioresorbable grafts closely parallel the kinetics of prosthetic resorption.
