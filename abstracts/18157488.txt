Arthroscopic fixation of anterior cruciate ligament tibial avulsion fractures using bioabsorbable suture anchors.
This article describes a new technique for the arthroscopic reduction and fixation of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tibial avulsion fractures using bioabsorbable suture anchors. This described technique requires the use of anterolateral, anteromedial, medial mid-patellar, and lateral mid-patellar portals. A suture hook loaded with No. 2 polydioxanone (PDS) was used to pierce the ACL through the anteromedial or anterolateral portal, and bioabsorbable suture anchors were inserted through the medial and lateral mid-patellar portals. The five patients treated using this technique were evaluated at 1 year postoperatively. All patients showed bony union without anterior laxity or flexion contracture. The described technique provides firm fixation of fracture fragment and can be used in both skeletally immature and mature patients.
