Biological osteosynthesis in osteochondral lesions of the talus.
Osteochondral lesions of the dome of the talus whether medial or lateral are rare. Surgical treatment is required when there is a loose body, or when the lesion is symptomatic and resistant to nonsurgical treatment. Usually, the degenerated fragment is removed, followed by curettage and multiple perforations of the subchondral bed, but different methods may be used to reinsert the osteocartilaginous fragment. Having been satisfied with our first studies conducted both on animals and man, we began to reinsert the osteochondral fragment by using resorbable means of synthesis. The purpose of this study is to report our experiences with 3 such cases at a minimum follow-up of one year.
