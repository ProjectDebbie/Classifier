Polydioxanone in vascular surgery. First experience with an absorbable suture in femoro-popliteal bypass.
The use of synthetic absorbable monofilament suture material (polydioxanone, PDS), is described for operative vascular surgery. Six anastomoses in three femoro-popliteal (tibial) vein bypass operations were performed. Angiographical control was carried out, when absorption was in progress (after a period of five months) or totally completed (within six months), and showed no dilatation or aneurysm formation at the suture line. One anastomosis was excised five months after the first intervention. Histological examination showed fragmented suture material and slight tissue reaction. Suture material characteristics in respect of tensile strength, pliability, knotting properties and visibility were judged critically.
