The best suture for hypospadias?
In a study designed to determine the best suture for use in hypospadias surgery, polydioxanone (PDS), chromic catgut, and polyglycolic acid (Dexon) were studied under similar conditions in the penile foreskin of 16 baboons. Gross and microscopic observations were made at intervals of six to forty-eight days. The wounds sutured with catgut were all healed by twenty-four days with complete suture resorption and no evidence of scar formation. Both polyglycolic acid and polydioxanone sutures showed delayed resorption, wound abscesses, and granulomas. Catgut remains the best available suture to use in the penile foreskin. Polyglycolic acid and polydioxanone sutures, because of their prolonged resorption and excess reaction, should not be used in hypospadias surgery.
