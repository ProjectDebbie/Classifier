Continuous single-layer serosubmucosal anastomosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
In a 4-year period, 100 anastomoses in the upper gastrointestinal tract were fashioned using a single serosubmucosal layer of continuous polydioxanone. One patient required revisional surgery because of anastomotic stricture after partial gastrectomy, but there was no other complication related to the anastomosis. This technique is simple, safe, and quick to perform.
