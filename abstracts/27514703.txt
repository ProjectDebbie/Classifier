Endoscopic biodegradable biliary stents in the treatment of benign biliary strictures: First report of clinical use in patients.
The first clinical experience of endoscopically inserted polydioxanone biodegradable biliary stents (BDBS) in the treatment of benign biliary strictures is reported. Two patients with a benign common bile duct stricture were endoscopically treated with 8-mm-bore BDBS during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Both BDBS insertions were technically successful and without adverse events. At 6 months, the stricture resolution was excellent and BDBS degradation was predicted in repeated magnetic resonance imaging. The first experience with endoscopic BDBS seems promising in the treatment of benign biliary strictures. During 6 months of follow up, BDBS seemed sufficient for remodeling and resolution of strictures. Further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of biodegradable biliary stents in endoscopic management of benign biliary strictures.
