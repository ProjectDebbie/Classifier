Absorbable clips for cystic duct ligation in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The efficacy and applicability of an absorbable polydioxanone (PDS) clip for cystic duct ligation were evaluated in 297 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The indications for cholecystectomy were symptomatic gallstones (179 patients), acute cholecystitis (67), biliary pancreatitis (23), acute cholangitis (24), and gallbladder polyp (4). Twenty-five patients required conversion to open surgery (8.4%). The conversion rate was 2.7% for uncomplicated and 17.5% for complicated gallbladder diseases. Of the 272 patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the cystic ducts were successfully ligated with PDS clips in 227 patients (83.5%). The success rate was higher in uncomplicated (163/178) than in complicated (64/94) gallbladder diseases (chi square = 24.6, P < 0.001). There was no clip-related complication on follow-up (range 0.4-39.2, median 17.5 months). In 45 patients, PDS clip failed. They were treated with endoloop (14 patients), Roeder slip knot (13), metallic clips and endoloop (8), metallic clips alone (6), and intracorporeal tie (4). The PDS clip is effective and applicable to the majority of patients. It should be attempted first because of the ease of application.
