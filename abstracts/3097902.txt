Effect of renacidin on suture material.
Renacidin solution is used sometimes to irrigate renal units with retained calculi after definitive stone surgery. The effects of this solution on the integrity of suture material utilized to close kidneys have not been determined previously. In an attempt to define the best suture material to use when postoperative renacidin irrigation is contemplated, we studied the effects of this solution on a variety of sutures commonly used in genitourinary surgery.
