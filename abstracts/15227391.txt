Use of absorbable sutures in canine carotid arteries.
To study the functional and microstructural characteristics of polydioxanone sutures in vascular surgery, we created 48 vascular anastomoses in the right and left common carotid arteries of 24 mongrel dogs. In each animal, polydioxanone sutures were used in 1 carotid artery, and polypropylene sutures were used in the contralateral carotid artery. Twelve groups of 2 animals each were then formed. The 1st group was observed for 1 month, the 2nd for 2 months, the 3rd for 3 months, and so on until the 12th group, which was observed for 12 months. At the end of each observation period, reoperation was undertaken to evaluate the vascular anastomoses by means of angiography and microscopy. The polypropylene anastomoses showed a marked deformity, with tissue retraction and a foreign body reaction. In contrast, the polydioxanone anastomoses exhibited satisfactory healing, without deformity, and were well tolerated histologically. We believe that polydioxanone may be a useful, alternative vascular suture material.
