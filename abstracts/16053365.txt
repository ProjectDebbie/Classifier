Ureteral pseudodiverticulum associated with absorbable suture clips after laparoscopic pyeloplasty: case report.
A 48 year-old woman with pyelonephritis was found to have bilateral ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction and a nonfunctioning right kidney. She initially underwent a laparoscopic left nondismembered pyeloplasty using absorbable polydioxanone Lapra-Ty suture clips (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH) to secure the anastomosis. An antegrade endopyelotomy was later necessitated. Both procedures were complicated by postoperative bacteruria and funguria. She then underwent a laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty, again utilizing Lapra-Ty suture clips to secure the anastomosis. Postoperatively, her course was complicated by anastomotic extravasation, bacteriuria, and funguria. Subsequently, an antegrade nephrostogram revealed a 2.5-cm diverticulum just distal to the UPJ, which contained numerous 2- to 4-mm filling defects. Nephroscopic exploration of the pseudodiverticulum revealed numerous Lapra-Ty clips, which were basket extracted. The pseudodiverticulum was fulgurated with a holmium laser. She eventually had restricturing with recurrence of the pseudodiverticulum and was treated successfully by open ureterocalicostomy.
