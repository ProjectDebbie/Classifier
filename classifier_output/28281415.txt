Use of a biodegradable, oversized stent in a child with tracheomalacia secondary to vascular external compression.
We describe the implantation of an absorbable, custom-made stent of polydioxanone to treat tracheomalacia in a 5-month-old patient with extrinsic compression by a double aortic arch. The use of an absorbable, oversized stent treated the tracheal collapse caused by vascular compression, avoided removal procedures, and allowed the infant's growth. The use of an oversized stent prevented stent migration and gave minimal problems of granulation.
