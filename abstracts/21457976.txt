A comparison of barbed and smooth sutures for ovine cesarean delivery.
To determine the adequacy of barbed and smooth sutures for closing the uterus and fascia in pregnant ewes. Nine ewes that underwent cesarean delivery were randomized to each receive 2 different suture materials for both the uterus and the fascia. The sutures used were: barbed poliglecaprone 25, smooth poliglecaprone 25, braided polyglactin 910, and smooth chromic sutures on the uterus; and barbed polydioxanone (PDO), barbed poliglecaprone 25, braided polyglactin 910, and smooth chromic sutures on the fascia. In 4 of the ewes, the fascia suture line failed prematurely, leading to dehiscence prior to planned euthanasia and necropsy. The remaining 5 ewes were euthanized on days 2, 7, or 28. All suture materials (smooth and barbed) were adequate for uterine closures. Barbed PDO, smooth poliglecaprone 25, and braided polyglactin 910 were adequate for fascia closures, whereas both barbed poliglecaprone 25 and smooth chromic resulted in premature suture line ruptures and fascia dehiscence. In a small pilot study, absorbable knotless barbed suture was adequate and equivalent to absorbable knotted smooth suture for closing the uterus following ovine cesarean delivery. On the rectus fascia, however, sutures-whether barbed or smooth-with lower tensile strength resulted in fascial dehiscence.
