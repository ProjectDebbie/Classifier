Reconstructive septal surgery.
To attain without compromise the surgical goal, a straight and concurrently solid septum, especially in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities (sometimes combined with external deformities), an excellent proven and well-known technique is extracorporal or external septoplasty. Surgery consists of excision of the quadrilateral cartilage and its division into straight fragments. To avoid postoperative sequelae such as saddling, the pieces of cartilage must be reconnected meticulously to form a straight and at the same time solid plate. This difficult and time-consuming procedure can be assisted by the use of a connecting material. Since 1996 we have been using a polydioxanone foil (PDS, Ethicon Norderstedt Germany) as the supporting material for this purpose. The PDS as well as the suture material is completely resorbed within 5 months, excluding long-term complications of other artificial implants.
