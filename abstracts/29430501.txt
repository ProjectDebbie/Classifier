Modified Internal Fixation Technique for Acromio-Clavicular (AC) joint dislocation: The "Hidden Knot Technique".
Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are common and often seen in contact athletes, resulting from a fall on the shoulder tip with adducted arm. This joint is stabilized by both static and dynamic structures including the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament. Most reconstruction techniques focus on CC ligament augmentation as the primary stabilizer of the AC joint. The best surgical technique for some AC joint dislocations is still controversial. In this study, we explained a modification of the CC ligament reconstruction technique described by Wellmann. The method is based on minimally invasive CC ligament augmentation with a flip button/polydioxanone (PDS) repair, typically used for extracortical ACL graft fixation. Patients commonly complain that heavy sutures under the skin in subcutaneous tissue irritate the skin and sometimes require reoperation for suture removal. We present an augmentation technique that resolves this issue by changing the suture knot location to the sub-clavicular position. II.
