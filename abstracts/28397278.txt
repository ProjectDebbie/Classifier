Polydioxanone plates are safe and effective for L-strut support in functional septorhinoplasty.
To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and result stability of polydioxanone (PDS) plate use for L-strut stabilization. Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort. Patients who underwent functional septorhinoplasty with the use of PDS plates between January 2013 and January 2017 were administered the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale pre- and postoperatively at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Patient demographics, reason for PDS use, graft type, complications, and outcomes were analyzed. Eighty-eight patients aged 34.3 years (standard deviation [SD] = 15.7 years; range, 7.5-71.5 years) were included. All patients were found to have a fracture and/or severe deviation of the L-strut for which the PDS plate was used for rigid support. Mean preoperative NOSE score 65.2 (SD = 22.1) significantly decreased to 19.6 (SD = 21.6) at 7.2 months (SD = 5.5 months) postoperatively. There were no significant differences in NOSE scores between follow-up time points. There was one complication, a septal abscess, and one revision. A PDS plate is a safe and effective material to be utilized in functional septorhinoplasty for patients with a fracture or iatrogenic injury to the septal L-strut or poor quality septal cartilage that requires stability without additional width. Outcomes are stable at 6 and 12 months, after the plate has dissolved. The use of a PDS plate may decrease the need for rib grafting in patients with a history of previous septoplasty and persistent nasal obstruction with a dorsal or caudal C-shaped septal deformity or fracture of the L-strut. 2c.
