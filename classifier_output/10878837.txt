Comparative study on biocompatibility and absorption times of three absorbable monofilament suture materials (Polydioxanone, Poliglecaprone 25, Glycomer 631).
Monofilament synthetic absorbable suture materials offer excellent glide characteristics and cause minimal tissue trauma as a result of their smooth monofilament structure and gradual bio-absorption. An investigation was conducted on 72 rats to compare three types of monofilament absorbable suture material (Polydioxanone, Poliglecaprone 25, Glycomer 631), with respect to their clinical characteristics, tissue inflammatory reaction and suture absorption times. The results identified different qualities for each suture: Poliglecaprone 25 and Glycomer 631 suture materials were found to be less reactive than Polydioxanone in rat skin. However, because of their extremely low tissue reaction values, all three materials were deemed particularly suitable for use as intracuticular sutures. Absorption times in rat skin were less than 3 months for Poliglecaprone 25, between 3 and 6 months for Glycomer 631 and 6 months for Polydioxanone. The differences in suture characteristics which were detected in our study can help in the surgical selection of the most appropriate suture material.
