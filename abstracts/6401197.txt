Studies on the efficacy and safety of polydioxanone monofilament absorbable suture.
Preclinical animal studies have clearly indicated that dyed and undyed polydioxanone monofilament absorbable sutures have prolonged breaking strength retention, a reliable absorption profile and minimal tissue reaction. The suture provides wound support throughout extended postoperative periods and is most useful in those situations in which prolonged suture integrity is desirable. Based upon these clinical studies, polydioxanone monofilament absorbable sutures must be considered as a reliable, easy to use suture material which fulfills all performance criteria. The over-all clinical results were excellent. Polydioxanone was rated as significantly superior to gut in every category evaluated. The results of this study support the claim that polydioxanone monofilament absorbable sutures are the suture of choice for general surgical use as well as in a variety of other clinical applications in which an absorbable suture is required.
