Assessment of indications and clinical outcome for the endoscopy-assisted combined subciliary/transantral approach in treatment of complex orbital floor fractures.
The treatment of complex orbital floor fractures with extensive orbital prolapse remains a surgical challenge in craniomaxillofacial traumatology and is still controversially discussed. Reduction of orbital tissue via a transcutaneous or transconjunctival approach alone can be very difficult and lead to unsatisfying results. Over a 3-year-period, we enrolled 13 patients who underwent endoscopy-assisted reconstruction of isolated orbital floor fractures via a combined subciliary and transantral approach. Patient data, imaging and ophthalmologic examination were reviewed prospectively. Ten patients underwent primary surgical treatment, 3 patients had secondary surgical treatment because of unsatisfactory results of primary surgical intervention. All patients had an uneventful postoperative course without ophthalmologic deterioration, no further surgical procedures were necessary. The additional use of an endoscopy-assisted transantral approach provides a reliable treatment modality in selected cases. To our knowledge, this is the only study of patients treated with a combined subciliary and transantral approach. Special emphasis was given to postoperative functional results, a short algorithm for use of an additional transantral endoscopy-assisted approach is presented.
