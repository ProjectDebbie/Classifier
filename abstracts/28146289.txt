In vitro evaluation of square and surgeon's knots in large gauge suture.
To investigate the strength and size of surgeon's and square knots for starting and ending continuous suture lines using large gauge suture. In vitro mechanical study. Knotted suture. Surgeon's and square knots were tested using 2 and 3 USP polyglactin 910 and 2 USP polydioxanone under linear tension on a universal testing machine. Failure mode and knot holding capacity (KHC) were recorded, and relative knot security (RKS) was calculated as a percentage of KHC. Comparisons were made between number of throws, suture size, suture type, and knot types. Knot volume and weight were assessed by a digital micrometer and balance, respectively. There were no significant differences in KHC (P = .295), RKS (P = .307), volume (P = .128), or weight (P = .310) between square and surgeon's knots at the start or end of suture lines with the same number of throws and suture type. A minimum of 6 throws were required for start knots and 7 throws at end knots to prevent unraveling. Knots tied with 3 polyglactin 910 were strongest (P < .001) and 2 polyglactin 910 produced knots with higher KHC and RKS than 2 polydioxanone (P < .001). No consistent differences were detected between knots types tied with the same suture material; however, number of throws affected KHC and RKS up to 6 throws in start or 7 throws in end knots. The configuration of square and surgeon's knots performed at the end of a continuous line alters their KHC, supporting the use of additional throws for knot security.
