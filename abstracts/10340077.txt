Comparison of a continuous suture pattern with a simple interrupted pattern for enteric closure in dogs and cats: 83 cases (1991-1997).
To describe and compare a simple continuous suture pattern with a simple interrupted pattern for enterotomy closure or end-to-end intestinal anastomosis. Retrospective study. 58 dogs and 25 cats that underwent enterotomy or intestinal resection and anastomosis. Signalment, surgical procedure, suture pattern, suture material, confirmation of dehiscence, and follow-up were reviewed. Groups were compared by procedure (anastomosis or enterotomy) and by suture pattern. 57 animals underwent continuous closure; 26 had interrupted closure. Only polydioxanone or polypropylene suture materials were used. Overall, 81 (98%) animals had no signs of intestinal dehiscence and survived > 2 weeks. Two animals had confirmed dehiscence after foreign body removal, 1 of 57 (2%) after continuous closure, and 1 of 26 (4%) after interrupted closure. The simple continuous closure pattern is an acceptable alternative to simple interrupted closure for small intestinal anastomosis or enterotomy closure.
