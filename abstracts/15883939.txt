Reconstruction of orbital floor fracture with polyglactin 910/polydioxanon patch (ethisorb): a retrospective study.
We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and the complications related to the use of Ethisorb (resorbable alloplastic material) in the reconstruction of orbital floor fractures. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent orbital floor fracture reconstruction with Ethisorb since 2001. We only included patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. The following data were recorded for every patient: age, gender, cause of trauma, time from trauma to surgery, signs and symptoms, concomitant ocular injuries, radiographic analysis, pertinent intraoperative findings (including the type of approach), follow-up time, and postoperative complications. Eighty-seven patients were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (24.1%) experienced postoperative complications. Of these, only 3 patients (3.4%) had permanent complications directly related to the Ethisorb membrane (diplopia, enophthalmos). Two of these patients required revision surgery and are discussed in the article. The results of our study demonstrate the effectiveness of Ethisorb in the repair of small-to-moderate orbital floor fracture defects (up to a maximum size of 2 x 2 cm).
