Management of enteroatmospheric fistula thanks to new isolation technique.
We aimed to present our method called as new isolation technique with stopper (NITS) to manage enteroatmospheric fistula (EAF) in an open abdomen (OA). The patient was a 71-year-old male with Hartmann colostomy and incisional hernia. A dual mesh was used for incisional hernia repair after colorectal anastomosis. The patient was urgently re-admitted to hospital due to EAF on the postoperative 30th day. The NITS application was performed twice at different times. General anesthesia was not required for the applications, but sterile conditions in operation room were provided. A Penrose drain was sutured with 5/0 polydioxanone onto the mucosa of EAF orifice. A small pool was created to protect enteric content from leakage. The leak test was performed by spilling saline into this pool. The sponge with visceral organ protector around the pool was adhered by adhesive sterile drape, and one opening was performed on drape. Negative pressure therapy was launched with -75 mmHg in continuous form. EAF was isolated from the OA wound and sponge with the help of stopper performed with adaptable and obstacle ring paste. After these two applications, EAF was converted to stoma. The anastomosis of small intestine was performed 45 days later. In our NITS system, control of EAF may be successfully provided besides prevention of loss of enteric fluid and electrolyte. Advantages of NITS: 1) Successful control in all types of EAF is possible with NITS. 2) The required material for NITS system can be found easily. 3) All types of EAF can be converted into stoma in a short time. Consequently, the therapy of EAF in Bj√∂rck 4 OA patients may be carried out successfully with NITS method.
