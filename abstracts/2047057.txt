A new clinch knot.
A new slip knot is introduced. It can be used as the beginning knot of a running suture and for ligation of pedicles where accessibility is limited. When used at the beginning of a running suture to close abdominal-wall fascia, the knot can be safely used with monofilament material such as polydioxanone. It locks readily, it takes less time to tie than numerous square knots, and it is not as bulky as other knots. The clinch knot has been found to be especially useful for securing pedicles in relatively inaccessible places such as the infundibulopelvic ligament when performing oophorectomy at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. During endoscopic surgery, the knot has been used as an alternative to the Endoloop and as the preferred knot to secure the Endo-knot.
