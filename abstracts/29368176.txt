Biomechanical performance of the Actifit<sup>®</sup> scaffold is significantly improved by selection of irrigation fluid.
Clinical reports on meniscal scaffolds seem promising, albeit relatively paucity exists regarding their biomechanical behavior. The aim of the study is to delineate the impact of differing suture materials and the type as well as the temperature of the irrigation fluid on the pull-out strength of a polyurethane meniscal scaffold (Actifit<sup>®</sup>). 128 specimens were utilized with horizontal sutures and uniaxial load-to-failure testing was performed. We compared two different suture materials-polydioxanone (PDS) and non-absorbable, braided polyester sutures (NABP)-as well as two common irrigation fluids-lactated Ringer's and electrolyte-free, hypotonic Mannitol-Sorbitol. All specimens were further evaluated according to two different temperatures [room temperature (20 °C) and near-core body temperature (37 °C)]. Mean load-to-failure was 53.3 ± 6.5 N. There was no significant difference between the NABP and the PDS group. Ringer group showed a significantly higher load-to-failure compared to Purisole (P = .0002). This was equivalent for both PDS (P = .0008) and NABP sutures (P = .0008). Significantly higher failure loads could be established for the 37° group (P = .041); yet, this difference was neither confirmed for the PDS or in in the NABP subgroup. Only the subgroup using Purisole at 37° showed significantly higher failure loads compared to 20° (P = .017). This study underlines the potential to improve pull-out strength during implantation of an Actifit<sup>®</sup> scaffold by alteration of the type of irrigation fluid. Lactated Ringer solution provided the highest construct stability in regard to load-to-failure testing and should be considered whenever implantation of a polyurethane meniscal scaffold is conducted.
