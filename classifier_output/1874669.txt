Effect of tissue adhesives and suture patterns on experimentally induced teat lacerations in lactating dairy cattle.
Tissue adhesives and suture materials were evaluated for repair of experimentally induced teat lacerations in 6 lactating dairy cows. Group-1 teat lacerations were not closed and served as nonsutured controls. Group-2 lacerations were closed in three layers (mucosa, submucosa, and skin) by use of 3-0 polydioxanone. Group-3 lacerations were closed by use of N-butyl cyanoacrylate monomer tissue adhesive. Group-4 lacerations were closed by use of a combination of sutures and tissue adhesive. All cows were milked by machine. Healing was observed for 28 days, then cows were slaughtered, and teats were recovered for further study. Evaluation revealed failure of healing of all layers with formation of large fistulas in 3 of 4 nonsutured control teats in group 1. All 6 teat lacerations in groups 2 and 3 healed satisfactorily with no fistulas. Five of 6 teats in group 4 had partial healing of skin and mucosa with no fistulas, and 1 teat failed to heal and developed a small fistula. Data indicated that closure of experimentally induced teat lacerations with three layers of fine absorbable suture or closure with tissue adhesive alone gave good results and satisfactory healing of all layers. However, when sutures and tissue adhesive were used together, foreign body reaction was marked, and the skin and submucosa healed only partially. Sutures appeared to entrap the tissue adhesive, resulting in a foreign body reaction.
