Use of polydioxanone absorbable monofilament sutures in orthopedic surgery.
The safety and efficacy of polydioxanone absorbable monofilament sutures was documented in 57 orthopedic surgery patients (32, dyed sutures; 25, undyed sutures), 55 of whom were followed for at least 42 days postoperatively. The other two patients were lost to follow up prior to 42 days. The final clinical outcome was excellent in all completed study subjects. No suture-related adverse effects were reported. Both dyed and undyed sutures were consistently better than surgical gut with respect to pliability, strength, ease of passage, ease of tying, fraying, knot security, and overall handling. Intraoperative visibility of dyed polydioxanone sutures was consistently superior to that of surgical gut. The visibility of undyed sutures was rated better than surgical gut in 16 cases, equal in 8, and worse in 1. Both the overall handling of the polydioxanone monofilament sutures and performance as it affected wound healing were significantly superior to those of surgical gut.
