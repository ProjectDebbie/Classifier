A prospective randomized comparison of continuous polydioxanone and interrupted Neurilon for neurosurgical wound closure.
A prospective, randomized study of continuous Polydioxanone with subcuticular vicryl closure is compared to interrupted Neurilon in a general neurosurgical practice. Ninety-nine patients were studied with 49 closed with Polydioxanone and 50 by Neurilon. The two groups were comparable with respect to risk factors and general composition. There was no significant difference in the rate of infection, wound dehiscence, CSF leak or suture protrusion, but Neurilon had a significantly higher incidence of palpable knots. Wound closure time was compared with no overall difference being found. We conclude that continuous Polydioxanone closure with subcuticular vicryl is an acceptable form of closure for neurosurgical wounds.
