Biological tolerance to polydioxanone absorbable clips: a comparison with metallic ligating clips.
An experiment was conducted in 96 rats to determine the tissue tolerance to a hemostatic and absorbable clip made of polydioxanone, as compared to standard metallic clips. Clinical tolerance was similar and no bleeding or death occurred because of the material. Pathological studies showed a mild histiocytic reaction with absorbable clips and a stronger inflammatory reaction with metallic clips. This experiment indicates that absorbable clips are efficient and well tolerated and we strongly recommend the use of this material.
