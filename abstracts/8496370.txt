Biodegradable fixation of physeal fractures in goat distal femur.
We compared the effectiveness of absorbable polylactic acid (PLA) screws and polydioxanone (PDS) pins with that of ASIF cannulated screws in stabilizing Salter-Harris IV fractures in goat distal femur. Eighteen juvenile goats were randomly divided into control (cannulated screw), PLA screw, and PDS pin groups. A Salter-Harris IV medial femoral condyle fracture was created and stabilized, and the goats were sacrificed 8 weeks postoperatively. Articular cartilage displacement < 1 mm was considered anatomic. All PLA screws were anatomic as compared with 83% (five of six) of the controls and 17% (one of six) of the pins. Absorbable PLA screws stabilized Salter-Harris IV fractures as well as cannulated screws and better than PDS pins.
