Tunica wedge excision to correct penile curvature associated with the inflatable penile prosthesis.
We encountered 7 cases of significant penile curvature after placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis. In 3 cases curvature was present preoperatively owing to Peyronie's disease and penile trauma, while in 4 it developed postoperatively owing to improper penile positioning. Curvature was straightened successfully by removal of small elliptical wedges of tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum from the convex surface of the curve and closing the defects created with 3-zero polydioxanone sutures. A subjectively gratifying result was achieved in each instance.
