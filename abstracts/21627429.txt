A randomised controlled trial evaluating the use of polyglactin (Vicryl) mesh, polydioxanone (PDS) or polyglactin (Vicryl) sutures for pelvic organ prolapse surgery: outcomes at 2 years.
The effects at 2 years of polyglactin (Vicryl) mesh inlay and polydioxanone (PDS) or polyglactin (Vicryl) suture material on prolapse symptoms, urinary, bowel, sexual function and prolapse related Quality-of-Life (QoL) in women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery were evaluated in a randomised controlled trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design of Vicryl mesh (n = 32) or not (n = 34) and PDS (n = 33) or Vicryl suture (n = 33). The response rate at 2 years was 82%. There were no differences in the prolapse symptom scores between the randomised groups. Prolapse-related QoL score (mean difference: 2.05, 95% CI 0.19-3.91) and urinary incontinence score (mean difference: 2.56, 95% CI 0.02-5.11) were significantly lower (better) in women who had Vicryl compared with PDS sutures. The apparent superiority of the prolapse-related QoL and urinary incontinence scores in women using Vicryl suture material (vs PDS) needs to be confirmed in a larger trial.
