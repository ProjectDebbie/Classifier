Polydioxanone suture material in growing vascular anastomoses. Experimental study.
We studied the growth of vascular anastomoses after use of absorbable suture material in 21 piglets. In six piglets, end-to-end anastomosis of the infrarenal aorta was performed with 5-0 continuous polypropylene suture; stenosis developed in two of these animals. In 15 piglets, continuous polydioxanone sutures were used for the anastomoses, and no stenosis developed. On the contrary, 14 of these anastomoses showed some degree of dilation at the anastomotic site. Burst testing to 300 mm Hg caused no disruption. On histologic examination, only scar tissue at media and intima with good degree of differentiation was noted. Growth of a vascular anastomosis after use of absorbable polydioxanone suture material seems to be perfectly possible without stricture formation. Because the growing process takes years instead of months in human beings, with obviously less stress at the anastomotic site, it is likely that dilatation at the level of the suture line will not occur in clinical use.
