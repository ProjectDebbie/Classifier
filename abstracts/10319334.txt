Evaluation of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) versus polydioxanone (PDS) for the repair of dura mater defects.
A comparative animal experimental study was performed to test the potential application of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vs. polydioxanone (PDS) as dural substitutes. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a right frontoparietal craniotomy, opening of the dura mater, and a small cortical lesion. The dural defect was covered with a piece of ePTFE or PDS. Animals were sacrificed at 30 days or 90 days. Following decalcification, heads including scalp, skull, and underlying brain were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and histologically analyzed. Dural defects repaired with ePTFE, showed minimal reactive changes and no adhesions to the brain surface. No foreign body type giant cell reaction was seen, and the graft became enclosed in a thin sheet of connective tissue. Dural defects repaired with PDS, showed some giant cell infiltration and ingrowth of collagen fibers. Both substitutes provided satisfactory biological function and biocompatibility. Expanded PTFE advantages included relative suppression of tissue ingrowth, ensheathment by connective tissue, and a high tearing strength. Although both materials show promise for use in dural grafting, further clinical studies are necessary to determine their potential applications as a human dural substitute.
