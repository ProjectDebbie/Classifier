Ligation of the ovarian pedicles in dogs with a resorbable self-locking device--a long-term follow-up study.
A prospective clinical trial was performed to evaluate applicability, hemostatic efficiency, and long-term tissue reactions of a novel medical device. The device was made of polydioxanone and designed in principle as a cable-tie with a flexible band running through a locking case. It was tested for ligation of the ovarian pedicles during ovariohysterectomy in nine intact female dogs. The dogs were followed-up monthly by physical examination and ultrasonography of the abdomen for 5-12 months after surgery. Macroscopic and histological post mortem examinations were performed in two dogs 7 and 18 months after surgery. Hemostasis was achieved with the devices although 1 of the 18 devices needed further tightening during a reoperation. Ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic device that caused acoustic shadowing, which decreased over time indicating gradual resorption. Post mortem examinations demonstrated adhesions and a local transient tissue reaction at site of the device. The results show that the device may be a future alternative for ligation of ovarian pedicles in dogs.
