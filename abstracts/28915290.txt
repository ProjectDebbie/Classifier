Lifting the Lower Face With an Absorbable Polydioxanone (PDO) Thread.
Traditional rejuvenation techniques include chemical peels, rhytidectomy of the skin, laser resurfacing, injection of dermal fillers and neurotoxins, and invasive surgical procedures. Patients with brow ptosis, jowl formation, and deepening nasolabial folds currently seek antiaging procedures with no incisions and minimal downtime such as thread-lifting with barbed sutures. The present report describes a case in which polydioxanone threads were used to lift the lower third of a patient's face. Fillers were used to supplement the results achieved by the thread lift because often, when tissue has been lifted, volume deficits are revealed, which can be corrected with dermal fillers. The procedure was performed in less than 30 minutes and was well tolerated. Mild swelling at the insertion points and general treatment area resolved within 7 days without intervention. Bruising was not observed. The patient showed remarkable improvement 7 months after the procedure. <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(9):932-934.</em></p>.
