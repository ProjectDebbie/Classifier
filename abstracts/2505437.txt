Calcinosis circumscripta associated with polydioxanone suture in two young dogs.
Calcinosis circumscripta associated with polydioxanone suture material was diagnosed in two young dogs. In each case, the owner noticed a firm mass at the site of a previous surgical incision. Mineralization of soft tissues was visible radiographically. At excision, multiple chalky white nodular masses within the subcutis extended in a linear pattern the length of the sutured incision, but not beyond it. Polydioxanone suture was identified within the center of the nodules, which were identified histologically as calcinosis circumscripta.
