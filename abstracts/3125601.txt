Neonatal surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The Gothenburg experience.
Thirty-four neonates (weights 0.97-4.47 kg) were operated on for coarctation of the aorta. They included five premature infants with birth weight less than or equal to 2.1 kg. All 34 were symptomatic, 31 severely so. Coarctation was "simple" in 12 cases and "complex" in 22; 12 with ventricular septal defect and 10 with more complex malformations. The mean age at operation was 11 days. Subclavian flap aortoplasty was used in 27 cases, a lusoric artery in two, and combined end-to-end anastomosis and flap repair in five. The main pulmonary artery was banded in 13 of the 22 complex coarctation syndromes. Absorbable suture was used in the last 22 cases. There was one early postoperative death. Serious ischaemic complications (bowel or limb gangrene) arose in four patients who were in severe heart failure preoperatively. During follow-up averaging 1.9 years there were two recurrences of coarctation. Resection with end-to-end anastomosis combined with subclavian flap aortoplasty when there is bulging ductal tissue or long, narrow isthmus and use of absorbable vascular suture may further lower the incidence of recurrent coarctation.
