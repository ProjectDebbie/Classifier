Surgical treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation.
Sixty-five patients were operated on for acromioclavicular dislocation between 1980 and 1991. Seventeen type II and 48 type III dislocations according to the criteria of Tossy et al. were treated. Three different surgical techniques were employed. (1) tension band wiring, (2) a modification of the Bosworth repair, (3) reconstruction of the ligaments with augmentation by a PDS (polydioxanon) cord. Forty-four patients could be investigated retrospectively, and an additional 12 were recorded by questionnaire. The Taft score was used, representing self-assessment, clinical statements and radiological findings. Of all investigated patients 87.5% had a normal range of motion without any loss of strength, and 32% suffered an osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint. The average Taft score was 9.8. With respect to the three surgical techniques, reconstruction of the ligaments augmented by a PDS cord produced the best result, an average Taft score of 10.8.
