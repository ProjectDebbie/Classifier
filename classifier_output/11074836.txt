Clinical and histological results of septoplasty with a resorbable implant.
The use of a resorbable implant connected with septal cartilage would facilitate external septoplasty, offering mechanical stability until the cartilage fragments heal. To study the histological and clinical results of septoplasty with a resorbable implant (polydioxanone [PDS; Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany]) in conjunction with cartilage. To provide histological information in 5 rabbits, PDS foil was implanted into the outer ear in conjunction with an artificial cartilage defect. Observations were made at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 25 weeks. Resorption of the implant was investigated, including the time to complete elimination. In addition, septoplasty with PDS foil was performed on 71 patients with severe septal deformities. Surgery consisted of excision of the quadrilateral cartilage and division into straight fragments, which were sutured to the PDS foil and replaced as a free graft. Ear, nose, and throat department of the General District Hospital Steyr, Steyr, Austria. Histological examination showed that the foil remained unchanged for at least 10 weeks and was completely resorbed after 25 weeks with minimal remaining scar tissue. Newly formed cartilage developed bordering the cartilage defect. In the clinical study, all patients experienced varying degrees of improvement in nasal blockage. No immediate or long-term complications occurred. The use of PDS foil in connection with cartilage facilitates surgical correction of severe septal deformities, additionally providing support for the nasal dorsum. The histological examination showed that no inflammatory or foreign body reaction occurred. Cartilage regeneration was even found. The foil was completely resorbed within 25 weeks, avoiding the long-term complications that occur with other artificial implants.
