Effectiveness of absorbable fixation devices in Austin bunionectomies.
Forty-eight Austin bunionectomies were fixated by using an absorbable fixation device. Twenty-three were fixated with a 1.5- or 2.0-mm diameter Biofix rod and twenty-five were fixated with a 1.3-mm diameter Orthosorb pin. To be included in this project, all patients were followed radiographically for a minimum of 3 months. One foot (4%) fixated with Biofix developed a sterile sinus discharge 3 months postoperatively after uneventful wound healing. There were no clinical or radiographic changes seen in the feet in which Orthosorb was used. Also, there were no infections or osteotomy dislocations with either fixation device.
