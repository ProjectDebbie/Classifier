Effect of human pancreatic juice and bile on the tensile strength of suture materials.
Several suture materials are used for pancreatojejunal anastomosis. In this study, we tested the durability of these suture materials in human pancreatic juice and bile. Plain and chromic catgut, polyglactin 910, polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone, polypropylene, and silk sutures were incubated in pancreatic juice and bile that was collected from patients. Fifteen samples of each type of suture material were placed in human juices for 1, 3, and 7 days. Tensile strengths were measured with a tensionmeter. Plain and chromic catgut disintegrated in pancreatic juice and pancreatic juice plus bile mixture. Polyglycolic acid and polyglactin 910 suture materials were vulnerable to pancreatic juice within 7 days. Polydioxanone retained most of its initial strength in pancreatic juice and bile. Polypropylene and silk retained 84% and 92% of their initial strength, respectively. We found that polidioxanone was the strongest suture material in pancreatic juice.
