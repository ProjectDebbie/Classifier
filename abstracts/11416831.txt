Saphenous vein harvesting by 'stripping' technique and 'W'-shaped patch covering after plaque incision in treatment of Peyronie's disease.
Harvesting of the saphenous vein tract by means of leg stripping is proposed in the treatment of Peyronie's disease. The technique of W-shaped saphenous vein after plaque incision to correct severe penile deformity associated with Peyronie's disease is described. Graft material was obtained from the lower saphenous vein by means of distal 'leg short stripping' technique. The size and number of tunical incisions depended on the size of the plaque. A 15 cm venous segment is generally sufficient to cover the defect. The venous segment used was W-shaped, assembled with 6/0 polydioxanone (PDS) uninterrupted sutures and then sutured to the albuginea defect. In our preliminary series of eight patients, penile shortening and erectile dysfunction is absent. Complete correction of penile deformity was achieved in seven patients (87.5%). One patient had minimal residual curvature (<20 degrees ) which did not result in difficulty with intromission. Saphenous harvesting by the stripping technique is not an invasive procedure and is quick and simple to perform. The W-shaped assembling technique is safe because the piece of saphena is kept intact and may be suited properly to the albuginea defect.
