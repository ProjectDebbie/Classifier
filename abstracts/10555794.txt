The use of polyglactin 910-polydioxanon in the treatment of defects of the orbital roof.
This study evaluated the use of polyglactin 910-polydioxanon (PPP) for repair of orbital roof defects. Between 1988 and 1996, 144 patients treated in the Department of Neurosurgery, Christian-Doppler-Medical-Center Salzburg, were operated on transcranially for fractures of the orbital roof or intraorbital tumors. In 85 of these 144 patients, PPP was used for reconstruction of the orbital roof or closure of the periorbita. The postoperative results in patients in whom the PPP patch was used for reconstruction of the orbital roof were compared with the results of a group treated without PPP. Even in severely injured patients, the reconstruction was judged to be very good in 71 patients (83.5%). PPP is a useful material for the reconstruction of the orbital roof.
