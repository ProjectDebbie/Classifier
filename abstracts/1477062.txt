Treatment of ruptures of the symphysis and iliosacral joint in pediatric patients.
The three osseous parts of the human pelvis form a continuous structure because of the symphysis and both iliosacral joints that-owing to their mobility-make possible a shock-absorption of vertical forces. The goal in the treatment of ruptures of the symphysis and/or of the sacroiliac joints is the restoration of functioning joints. Especially in the adolescent, a stiffening of these joints has to be avoided. Therefore, we treat ruptures of the pelvic joints with an overbridging banding that preserves the function of shock absorption. Due to utilisation of a banding, made up of polydioxanone, another operation to remove internal fixation material is not necessary. Rupture of the symphysis or iliosacral joint in the pediatric patient is very rare. Only three among the 67 patients whom we operated on because of a rupture of the symphysis or iliosacral joints between 1984 and 1990 were children. These were an eleven-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy, who had suffered a rupture of the symphysis, and an eight-year-old boy with a disrupted iliosacral joint. In these children a banding with PDS suture was performed. At a follow-up examination, the children were free from pain and did not feel restricted in their daily routine or their physical activities.
