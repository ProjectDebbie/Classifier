Primary results of chest wall reconstruction with polydioxanone mesh on animals.
With the development of surgical techniques and biomedical material, increasing synthetic materials are applied to the chest wall reconstruction, such as autologous rib, muscle flap, bovine pericardium and sheet metal. To detect the safety and efficiency of synthetic material Polydioxanone (PDO) in chest wall reconstruction. Healthy adult mongrel dogs operated with PDO, and then some clinical data were collected. Here we showed that PDO mesh could close down the function of chest wall defect, and PDO mesh could be degraded gradually and forms a fibrous layer with the surrounding tissues. Our data further demonstrated PDO mesh leads to slight lung adhesion with a small shrinkage. These findings thus provide the first evidence that the feasibility of PDO mesh in chest wall reconstruction in dogs.
