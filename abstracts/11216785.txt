Absorbable pulmonary artery banding in tricuspid atresia.
A child with tricuspid atresia, concordant ventriculoarterial connections, large ventricular septal defect, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure underwent pulmonary artery banding with a polydioxanone ribbon. This procedure was successful in this patient as the ventricular septal defect became restrictive while the banding was fully absorbed after 5 months. This technique could be included in the panel of surgical strategies for patients with single ventricle physiology and potential but insufficient subpulmonary stenosis in early infancy.
