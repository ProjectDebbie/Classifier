Primary stability of a PGLA/Polydioxanone membrane for potential autologous chondrocyte implantation in the hip joint. A cadaveric study.
The purpose of this cadaveric study was to evaluate the primary stability of a membrane  (resorbable polyglactin-910/poly-p-dioxanone) for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) inserted by press-fit into defects in the femoral head and acetabulum. The stability of the membrane was evaluated after implantation in a cartilage defect on both sides of the joint in 12 hips in six cadavers. The hip was manually put through a full range of motion for 50 cycles after each lesion had been created and filled, starting with the acetabulum. The implanted membranes showed stability in 83.3% of the acetabular defects and in 33.3% of the femoral defects after the 50 cycles. After an additional 50 cycles the acetabular membrane showed stability in a total of eight (67%) out of 12 acetabular lesions. The results indicate that this membrane tissue is potentially stable in cartilage defects of the acetabulum, which may have clinical applications in autologous chondrocyte implantation.
