Arthroscopic direct repair for radial tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex.
Although various repair techniques for Palmer type 1B lesions of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) have been introduced, arthroscopic repair techniques for Palmer type 1D lesions are still being honed. Until recently, inside-out techniques have commonly been used to repair radial tears of the TFCC. However, that technique has the disadvantages of a requirement for an extra skin incision, pain resulting from prominent subcutaneous suture knot stacks, and peripheral nerve injury. We describe an all-arthroscopic direct-repair technique using a suture hook with 2-0 polydioxanone that is relatively simple and safe and is thus a useful alternative for radial tears of the TFCC.
