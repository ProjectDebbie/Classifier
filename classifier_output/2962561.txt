Closure of abdominal wounds with polydioxanone. A prospective study.
Polydioxanone, an absorbable synthetic monofilament suture, was used to close abdominal wounds in 200 consecutive operative procedures. All patients were followed up for one year. Despite a high incidence of risk factors for impaired wound healing, the incidence of dehiscence and evisceration was zero; incisional hernia occurred in 2.9% of vertical midline wounds and in 3.6% of transverse incisions. This new suture material is safe and effective for closure of abdominal wounds.
