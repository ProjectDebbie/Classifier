In vitro loss of tensile strength and elasticity of five absorbable suture materials in sterile and infected canine urine.
The loss of breaking strength and elasticity of five absorbable suture materials (polydioxanone [PDS-II], polyglycolic acid [PGA], polyglactin 910 [PG-910], polyglyconate [GTMC], and chromic gut) after in vitro incubation in sterile, Escherichia coli- and Proteus mirabilis-inoculated canine urine was studied. Biomechanical testing, in a controlled environment, was performed during the 28-day study period. Polydioxanone and chromic gut retained greater than 90% of their original strengths after 28 days of incubation in sterile urine and 87% of original strengths in E. coli-inoculated urine. Polyglyconate retained 24% and 18% of original strength, respectively, after incubation in sterile and E. coli-inoculated urine for 28 days. Polyglycolic acid and PG-910 retained less than 30% of original strength in sterile urine and only 7% in E. coli-inoculated urine after 21 days of incubation. In P. mirabilis-inoculated urine, loss of tensile strength and elongation was significant for all suture materials. Polyglycolic acid and PG-910 lost all strength after 24 hours of incubation. Polydioxanone lost all strength after 7 days of incubation, whereas GTMC retained 19% at day 7. Chromic gut retained 78% at day 7 and 16% after 21 days of incubation, however, the absence of normal phagocytic destruction of chromic gut in this in vitro study may have artificially elevated these values. In sterile urine with chemically modified pH, loss of strength and elongation was greater in alkaline urine than in neutral or acidic urine for all types of suture materials.
