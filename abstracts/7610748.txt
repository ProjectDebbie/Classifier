Reconstruction of complete acromioclavicular separations (Tossy III) using PDS-banding as augmentation: experience in 64 cases.
Sixty-four patients with an acute type Tossy III acromioclavicular separation were treated surgically. Both the coracoclavicular ligaments and the ligaments of the acromioclavicular joint were reconstructed. An additional ligamenteous augmentation was performed, using completely resorbable 5 and 10 mm PDS bands. Thirty-nine patients (61%) were reexamined (follow-up time 2-45 months, mean 26 months).  were good to excellent in 77% of cases. In 91% of patients, a range of motion with an abduction deficit of less than 20 degrees was obtained. Calcifications in the area of the coracoclavicular or acromioclavicular ligaments did not affect the final range of motion. Complications consisted of a subcutaneous infection in one case, a deep infection in another patient and one reluxation. PDS banding enables an early functional postoperative treatment. Implant removal is not required. Complications as breakage or migration of metal implants are avoided.
