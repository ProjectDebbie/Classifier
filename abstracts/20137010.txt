Use of a biodegradable self-expanding stent in the management of a benign oesophageal stricture in a cat.
An 11-year-old domestic shorthair cat presented with a six-week history of regurgitation following a dental procedure. Endoscopy identified a single oesophageal stricture in the cervical oesophagus. Stricture reformation occurred following endoscopic balloon catheter dilation on two occasions. Following a third balloon dilation a biodegradable polydioxanone self-expanding stent was placed across the stricture site. Following the implantation the cat was able to eat soft canned food orally without regurgitation. Fluoroscopic examination performed four months after placement indicated that the stent was no longer present and the cervical oesophagus was able to pass boluses of canned food with no signs of obstruction.
