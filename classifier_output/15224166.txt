Augmentation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction-a histological and biomechanical study on goats.
We studied reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in skeletally mature goats. In one group, the autogenous tissue was augmented with polydioxanone (PDS), the other group had no augmentation. Histological complete incorporation and remodeling of the transplant was found in both groups. The newly formed connective tissues gradually assumed the microscopic properties of the normal ligament. The augmented group showed a delay in remodeling and maturation of the fiber bundles. Mechanically, the PDS-augmented transplants were stronger than the nonaugmented transplants immediately after surgery. During the first 6 weeks, a rapid decrease in strength of the augmented transplants was found, whereas the strength of the nonaugmented group gradually increased. The results of our experiment do not favor augmentation of autografts in reconstruction of the ACL.
