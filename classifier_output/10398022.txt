Physeal response to absorbable polydioxanone bone pins in growing rabbits.
Absorbable fixation materials would seem especially useful for treating transphyseal fractures in growing children, but their degradation products may affect physeal growth. The histologic response of an open physis to placement of transphyseal, polydioxanone (PDS), bioabsorbable pins was studied in skeletally immature New Zealand White rabbits. A 1.3-mm PDS pin was inserted across the right femoral physis, and a 1.3-mm empty drill hole across the left femoral physis served as a control. The animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks postsurgery. Biplanar radiographs, bone length measurements, and histology sections of the physis and adjacent bone were made. Three independent observers graded the histologic response of the physis to the drilling and implant. There was no evidence of inflammation, foreign body reaction, or distortion of the growth plate during the entire growth period. This suggests bioabsorbable pins do not cause any appreciable inflammatory response or adverse effect on physeal function during active longitudinal growth of the bone.
