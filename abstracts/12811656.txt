Laparoscopic resection of type I choledochal cyst.
Type I choledochal cyst is a rare saccular or fusiform congenital dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tract. It is usually treated by laparotomy at which the cyst is completely excised and a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is performed to establish biliary enteric drainage. We report the laparoscopic excision and hepaticoduodenostomy of type I choledochal cyst in two girls aged 1 and 3 years. The entire procedure was performed laparoscopically using needlescopic instruments. A 7-mm telescope port was inserted at the umbilicus, a 3-mm port in the right upper quadrant, and a 6-mm port in left upper quadrant. An additional 3-mm fan-shaped liver retractor was passed through the abdominal wall without a trocar. The gallbladder and choledochal cyst was dissected and removed en bloc. The lower end of the common bile duct was closed with 5-0 polydioxanone. The duodenum was anastomosed to the common hepatic duct below the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. There were no intraoperative complications, and the children were asymptomatic with no episodes of cholangitis at 6 months follow-up. Pediatric surgeons trained in advanced laparoscopic techniques including intracorporeal suturing can perform laparoscopic repair of choledochal cyst safely.
