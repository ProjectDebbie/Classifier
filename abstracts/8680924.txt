Comparison of seven different suture materials in the feline oral cavity.
Seven different suture materials were implanted into the oral tissues of 12 cats. The sutures and surrounding tissues were retrieved en bloc from each of two cats on days one, three, seven, 14, 21, and 28 postimplantation. Tissue reaction and suture duration were evaluated by gross visual observation and histological examination. Chromic gut disappeared between days three and seven; polyglactin 910 disappeared between days 14 and 21; and polyglycolic acid disappeared as early as seven to 14 days. Polydioxanone still was intact at day 28 and is recommended as an absorbable material for procedures in which longer healing time is anticipated. All the nonabsorbable suture materials (i.e., polypropylene, stainless steel, and nylon) were intact at day 28 postimplantation. Visual inspection showed polypropylene to have the least tissue reaction.
