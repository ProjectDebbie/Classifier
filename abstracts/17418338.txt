The Di Giacomo technique: simplified suture passing in SLAP repair.
A 30 degrees arthroscope is introduced via the posterior soft spot portal, and an anterosuperior portal is created with the use of a 7-mm disposable cannula. The anterosuperior portal is used for instrumentation. An 18-gauge spinal needle is passed via the portal of Neviaser and the rotator cuff into arthroscopic view above the superior labrum. A No. 1 polydioxanone suture (PDS; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is advanced through the spinal needle. An arthroscopic retriever or meniscal clamp is used to retrieve the free end of the suture and bring it out through a small anterior stab wound. A suture anchor is inserted via the anterosuperior portal into the superior neck of the glenoid. The more medial limb of the No. 2 Ethibond suture (Ethicon) from the suture anchor is retrieved with the inferior limb of the No. 1 PDS suture, and both are brought out through the anterosuperior cannula. The opposite end of the No. 1 PDS suture is then manually pulled, while, under direct arthroscopic visualization, the No. 2 Ethibond suture, now tied to the opposite end of the PDS, is pulled through the superior labral tissue. That anchor suture is retrieved and is placed outside the cannula that contains the other anchor suture. Standard arthroscopic knot tying is then employed.
