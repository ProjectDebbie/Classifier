Influence of soluble suture factors on in vitro macrophage function.
Suture materials may interact with immune competent cells and thereby affect localized immunity. Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and coordinate wound healing. They are also involved in the clearance of foreign material, bacteria and malignant cells. We studied the influence of soluble factors associated with silk, steel, nylon, polyglactin, polydioxanone and chromic catgut sutures on macrophage adherence, phagocytosis and the production of lysozyme and tumour necrosis factor. Soluble factors from suture materials influenced macrophage behaviour in vitro causing cellular activation, functional impairment and alterations in secreted levels of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor and the bactericidal agent lysozyme. Of the six materials studied, polyglactin had the most extreme effect, causing significant inhibition of cell adherence and lysozyme production. Silk also exerted a considerable effect on macrophages, significantly inhibiting adherence. In contrast, steel and polydioxanone media caused minimal inhibition of macrophage function although, as with all materials, they did activate the cells. This study has demonstrated that sutures release immunotoxic factors which considerably influence macrophage behaviour in vitro. These effects may have important clinical implications.
