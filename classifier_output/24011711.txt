A 5-fluorouracil-loaded polydioxanone weft-knitted stent for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
In-stents restenosis caused by tumour ingrowth is a major problem for patients undergoing stent displacement because the conventional stents often lack a sustained anti-tumour capability. The aim of this paper was to develop a weft-knitted polydioxanone stent which can slow release 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In order to determine the most suitable drug concentration, the 5-FU safe concentration in vivo and appropriate loading percentage in the membranes were investigated, and then 5-FU-loaded poly-l-lactide membranes at concentration of 3.2%, 6.4% and 12.8% were coated onto the stent using electro-spinning method, respectively. The morphology, chemical structure and in vitro drug release property of the coating membranes were subsequently examined. Their anti-tumour activity and mechanism were assessed in vitro and in vivo using a human colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 and tumour-bearing BALB/c nude mice. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the median lethal dose (LD50) demonstrated that the 6.4% and 12.8% membranes had better anti-tumour effects than pure 5-FU due to the sustainable drug releasing property of the coated membranes on the stent. The membranes possessing appropriate drug loading doses, such as 6.4% or 12.8% also provided better anti-in-stents restenosis effects than other groups tested. Therefore, it is concluded that the drug-loaded stents have great potential for the use in the treatment of intestinal cancers in the future.
