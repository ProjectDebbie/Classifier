Transcaruncular approach for reconstruction of medial orbital wall fracture.
Medial orbital wall fractures can cause horizontal diplopia and enophthalmos. Therefore, reconstruction of displaced medial wall fractures should be considered. We used a transcaruncular approach in five male patients to reconstruct the medial orbital wall after acute injuries and also as a secondary procedure for enophthalmos correction. Four of these patients had a concomitant orbital floor fracture. The incision was made in the caruncule and extended in the conjunctiva superior and inferior into the fornices for 10-12 mm. The tissue was bluntly dissected in an anteroposterior direction. The periosteum was incised dorsal of the posterior lacrimal crest and after elevation of the periosteum, the fractured orbital wall was visible. Transplants up to a height of 2 cm could be inserted for reconstruction of the medial orbital wall. In the cases of acute trauma, the medial wall was reconstructed using a resorbable polydioxanone plate. Cortical bone was used for the reconstruction of late enophthalmos. No postoperative complications were found. The transcaruncular approach gave a rapid entry to the fractured medial orbital wall without a visible scar.
