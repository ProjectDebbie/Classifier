Experimental and clinical investigations on the suitability of polydioxanone threads for cerclage of the eyeball.
Absorbable polydioxanone (PDS; Ethicon) threads were used for cerclage of the eyeball. Experimental investigations on rabbits have proved that PDS is well tolerated by surrounding eye tissues, does not cause any side effects, and has a sufficiently long time of absorption to ensure chorioretinal cicatrization. 81.25% of reattachments were achieved in humans after the first operations, and 87.5% after the second operation. The authors conclude that PDS is good ocular cerclage material, but we would prefer it in the shape of a band.
