Sternal closure with reabsorbable pin and cord in pediatric-less invasive cardiac surgery.
In pediatric less invasive cardiac surgery, we recently closed a patient's sternum using reabsorbable radiolucent poly-(L-lactide) acid sternal pins together with multifilament polydioxanone cord after a lower partial median sternotomy. This combination completely prevents postoperative sternal deformity, and leaves no radiopaque material identifiable radiographically, which is a significant cosmetic benefit.
