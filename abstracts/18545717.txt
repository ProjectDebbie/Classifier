Biomechanical characteristics of allogeneic cortical bone pins designed for fracture fixation.
The biomechanical characteristics of 1.2 mm diameter allogeneic cortical bone pins harvested from the canine tibia were evaluated and compared to 1.1 mm diameter stainless steel pins and 1.3 mm diameter polydioxanone (PDS) pins using impact testing and four-point bending. The biomechanical performance of allogeneic cortical bone pins using impact testing was uniform with no significant differences between sites, side, and gender. In four-point bending, cortical bone pins harvested from the left tibia (204.8 +/- 77.4 N/mm) were significantly stiffer than the right tibia (123.7 +/- 54.4 N/mm, P = 0.0001). The site of bone pin harvest also had a significant effect on stiffness, but this was dependent on interactions with gender and side. Site C in male dogs had the highest mean stiffness in the left tibia (224.4 +/- 40.4 N/mm), but lowest stiffness in the right tibia (84.9 +/- 24.2 N/mm). Site A in female dogs had the highest mean stiffness in the left tibia (344.9 +/- 117.4 N/mm), but lowest stiffness in the right tibia (60.8 +/- 3.7 N/mm). The raw and adjusted bending properties of 1.2 mm cortical bone pins were significantly better than 1.3 mm PDS pins, but significantly worse than 1.1 mm stainless steel pins (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, cortical bone pins may be suitable as an implant for fracture fixation based on initial biomechanical comparison to stainless steel and PDS pins used in clinical practice.
