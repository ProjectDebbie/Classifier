An experimental comparison of suture materials for tracheal and bronchial anastomoses.
Tracheal anastomosis, after circumferential resection, and bronchial anastomosis, after sleeve resection, have become widely accepted procedures. Nevertheless, there appears to be no agreement as to the optimal suture material for these anastomoses. Fifty-two rabbits were operated on, and 10 cervical tracheal rings were resected in each animal. End-to-end anastomosis was performed using 5/0 silk, chronic catgut, Teflon-coated polyester, coated polyglactin 910, polypropylene, or polydioxanone sutures. Twelve rabbits died. Rabbits which survived the intended length of time were evaluated with respect to acute and chronic inflammation and stricture formation. The results suggest that polypropylene is the best suture material, whereas silk is the worst material. Monofilament sutures should be used with caution for bronchial anastomosis, as their bristly knots can perforate adjacent blood vessels.
