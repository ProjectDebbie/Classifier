Cell seeded decellularised allogeneic matrix grafts and biodegradable polydioxanone-prostheses compared with arterial autografts in a porcine model.
small diameter vascular grafts are limited by their restricted availability, early thrombosis, and requirement for anticoagulants. to evaluate different approaches to biocompatible vascular grafts. sixteen allogeneic acellularised arteries seeded with autologous endothelial cells were implanted to replace a segment of the common carotid artery (group I). Other animals received polydioxanone prostheses (group II: inner diameter, i.d. 4 mm, n=18; group III, i.d. 5 mm, n=20) or arterial autografts (group IV, n=8). Graft patency was evaluated by means of ultrasound duplex scanning, angiography and histology. patency was 54% (71%), 17% (0%), 50% (50%), and 100% (100%) in group I, II, III, and IV after 1 week (4 months), respectively. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found for group IV versus all other groups at 1 week, as well as for group IV versus groups II and III, for group II versus III, and group I versus II at 4 months. small diameter vascular grafts can be engineered from an acellular allogeneic matrix seeded with autologous cells. Patency is superior to polydioxanone prostheses but inferior to the arterial autograft.
