Enteroplication in cats, using suture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate adhesive.
Enteroplication has been recommended to prevent recurrence of intussusception in dogs and cats. This study investigated the impact of enteroplication on subsequent function of the plicated small intestine as measured by transit time of barium impregnated polyethylene spheres (BIPS) and compared two methods of achieving enteroplication--sutures using polydioxanone and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Twenty-two healthy young cats were used--four controls, nine sutured and nine glued. The mean +/-SD transit times before, one week after and four weeks after enteroplication were respectively 2.0+/-0.80 hours, 1.6+/-0.80 hours, 2.2+/-1.18 hours. There was no significant difference in transit time or in the time to create enteroplication in the two plicated groups. Maintenance of intestinal adhesion was greater for the sutured plications. There was no significant change in internal diameter with either technique. Adverse clinical signs after enteroplication were not severe, however, they were more prevalent in cats which had glued plication. The inflammation associated with the suture was of a greater depth initially but that associated with the adhesive was more widespread and persisted for the four weeks of the experiments. Enteroplication in cats was a relatively benign procedure which did not cause significant alterations in small intestinal function. However, cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive cannot be recommended for this clinical procedure.
