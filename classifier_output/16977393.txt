Tissue reaction and surface morphology of absorbable sutures after in vivo exposure.
Tissue reaction to suture materials depends mainly on how the polymer they are composed of interacts with the tissues. There are few in vivo studies evaluating the suture material modifications resulting from its interaction with tissues. This paper aimed to study rat subcutaneous tissue reaction to irradiated polyglactin 910, polydioxanone, poliglecaprone 25 and chromic gut and its correlation with the ultra-structural alterations the materials undergo. The histological alterations were studied on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after suture implantations. In these periods, the materials were removed from the tissues and their surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Irradiated polyglactin 910 stimulated the formation of multinucleated giant cells and its filaments underwent cleavage and dissolution. In potydioxanone, a few inflammatory cells and scar fibrosis was observed, and triangular cracks appeared on its surface. Around the poliglecaprone 25, a diffused infiltration of a few mononuclear cells and fibrosis was recorded and formation of craters was observed on its surface. Chromic gut induced necrosis and granulation tissue and underwent dissolution in the tissues during the studied periods. In this study, it was observed that suture materials induced differentiated tissue reactions and morphologic surface changes, suggesting that indications should be individualized.
