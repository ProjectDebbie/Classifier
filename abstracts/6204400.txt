Polydioxanone in cardiovascular surgery.
Polydioxanone (PDS) suture material was used in vascular anastomoses in patients submitted to femoropopliteal bypass (10 patients), aortoiliac endarterectomy (5 patients), and aortocoronary bypass (5 patients). Clips of this material and conventional metallic clips were compared in vitro for holding-in-place properties, and PDS clips were used in ligation of branches of the autologous vein grafts in femoropopliteal bypass (10 patients) and aortocoronary bypass (10 patients). There were no complications related to the PDS material either intraoperatively or during the follow-up from 3 to 6 months. The PDS clips did not slip when burst-tested in vitro. The material is suitable and advantageous in cardiovascular operations where autologous tissue is handled.
