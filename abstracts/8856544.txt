Biodegradable pins versus Kirschner wires in hand surgery.
We compared biodegradable pins with standard Kirschner wires in the fixation of fractures, arthrodeses and osteotomies in the hand in a prospective, randomized study. Eleven patients were allocated to the biodegradable pin group and 12 to the Kirschner wire group. Age, gender, operative procedure and postoperative treatment did not differ in the two groups. All patients were evaluated after 6 months. No differences in time to union or complication rates were found, but the number of additional operative procedures in the Kirschner wire group significantly exceeded the number needed in the biodegradable pin group.
