Knot security of suture materials.
The knot security of chromic gut, polyglycolic acid, polyglactin 910, polydioxanone, polypropylene, and monofilament nylon size 2-0 suture materials were tested biomechanically in vitro. Twenty reproducible knots were tied and incubated in canine serum at 37 degrees for 24 hours before testing. A "secure knot" was defined as a knot that, when tested to failure, broke rather than untied by slippage. The minimum number of throws necessary to make a secure, snug (1500 g tension) square knot was three for gut, polyglycolic acid, polyglactin 910, and polypropylene and four for polydioxanone and nylon. All throws including the first were counted. With all suture materials tested, surgeon's knots were as secure as square knots. Only gut, polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone granny knots were as secure as square knots; no loosely tied (500 g tension) asymmetric square knots were as secure as snug square knots, and only polydioxanone and polypropylene loose square knots were as secure as snug square knots. Square knots used to start a continuous pattern required one additional throw with gut, polydioxanone, and nylon. Square knots used to end a continuous pattern required two to three additional throws with all materials tested.
