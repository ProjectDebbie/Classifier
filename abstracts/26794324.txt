Long-term results following polydioxanone sling fixation technique in unstable lateral clavicle fracture.
Neer type II (Edinburgh type 3B) fractures of the lateral clavicle are unstable fractures. The optimal management of these fractures remains controversial with many surgical techniques described in the literature. Our study reports the long-term results of a modified suture (1.5-mm polydioxanone cord) and sling technique for these fractures to avoid complications associated with current techniques in the literature. Over a 5-year period, 23 patients who were (12 males, 11 females; 14 left, 9 right) with a mean age of 42 years were treated with this technique. At last follow-up, the mean Oxford score was 45.1 (range 36-48); the mean SPADI score was 7.4 (range 0-32.3); and the mean Constant score was 91.5 (range 71-100). There were one non-union and no malunion. All patients in our series, except one, returned to their pre-injury activity level. This modified suture fixation technique is safe, technically simple to perform and cheap. It achieves excellent rates of fracture union without the complications associated with other fixation methods in the literature.
