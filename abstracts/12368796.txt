The double-loop technique for meniscal suture.
The authors describe a modified method for arthroscopic meniscal repair in which polydioxanone sutures are placed in the torn meniscus using needles and nylon loops. Conventional methods require the use of expensive instruments, which are not always available. However, our method is fast and simple. This technique also simplifies inserting multiple sutures to achieve adequate stability of the torn meniscus.
