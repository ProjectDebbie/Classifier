Meniscal repair using an all-inside, rapidly absorbing, tensionable device.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical success rate of all-inside meniscal repairs using a rapidly absorbing device in patients undergoing concurrent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. Patients with menisci repaired using the polydioxanone Mitek RapidLoc (Depuy Mitek, Raynham, MA) during concurrent ACL reconstruction were evaluated clinically 2 years following index surgery. We performed examinations on 38 meniscal tears in 30 patients using the International Knee Documentation Committee form and the Knee Disorders Subjective History visual analog scale. We also performed physical examinations for an effusion, joint line tenderness, McMurray's testing, and KT-1000 arthrometry (MEDmetric, San Diego, CA). The clinical success rate for meniscal repair was 86.8% (33 of 38) at a mean follow-up of 30.4 months (range, 21 to 56 months). Univariate analysis revealed sex as the only predictive variable for failure; all failures occurred in male patients. Nonpredictive variables included tear length, type, and configuration; a duration of more than 3 months, compartment, zone, ligament graft choice, age, follow-up, Tegner score, and visual analog scale score. The polydioxanone RapidLoc device was found to have a clinical success rate of 86.8%. These data suggest that the more rapidly absorbing polydioxanone device is effective for all-inside meniscal repair during concurrent ACL reconstruction. Level IV, therapeutic case series.
