Initial evaluation of absorbable polydioxanone suture for peripheral vascular surgery.
The long-term integrity of an autogenous vascular anastomosis is primarily dependent on the strength of tissue healing; therefore permanent mechanical support of an autogenous anastomosis with sutures is unnecessary. In this study we evaluated monofilament absorbable polydioxanone as an alternative to polypropylene for suturing autogenous vascular tissue during adult peripheral vascular operations. We used polydioxanone suture for 21 vascular procedures in 20 patients. We evaluated suture handling characteristics during operation and then followed patients with clinical assessments and serial duplex scans to monitor for pseudoaneurysms, anastomotic narrowing, and vessel patency. Indications for surgery included limb salvage (67%), dialysis access (23%), traumatic arteriovenous fistula and claudication (5% each). The operative procedures included infrainguinal bypass (57%), arteriovenous fistula formation (24%), thromboembolectomy (14%), and arteriovenous fistula repair (5%). Polydioxanone sutures were placed in 39 separate test sites (35 arterial, 4 venous). No deaths occurred during operation. Polydioxanone suture was found to have handling characteristics similar to polypropylene. During mean patient follow-up of 7.2 +/- 0.6 months, we found no cases of anastomotic narrowing or pseudoaneurysms. Actuarial test site patency at 1, 3, and 6 months was 97%, 97%, and 86%, respectively. Polydioxanone suture has handling properties that are acceptable for use in vascular applications, and it provides adequate mechanical support for sutured vessels to heal. A randomized trial comparing polydioxanone with polypropylene suture will be necessary to determine whether the lack of permanent foreign material in vascular anastomoses can improve long-term patency.
