Mechanical properties of collagen membranes modified with pores--are they still sufficient for orbital floor reconstruction?
Adequate mechanical strength is essential for materials used to reconstruct the orbital floor, and collagen membranes have recently been suggested for the repair of isolated fractures of the orbital floor. However, their mechanical properties after modification with pores for increased drainage of blood into the sinus have not been sufficiently investigated. We have tested the mechanical resistance of polydioxanone foils (PDS) to distortion and compared it with that of 3 resorbable collagen membranes (Smartbrane(®), Bio-Gide(®), and Creos(®)) in mint condition and when artificially aged (3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks) after modification with pores (diameter 2mm) in a standard configuration (n=12 in each group). PDS and Creos(®) had comparable initial values for mechanical resistance of about 2.3N/mm(2), and Bio-Gide(®) and Smartbrane(®) had about 20% and 80% lower initial mechanical resistance, respectively. All materials tested had lower values after artificial ageing. After eight weeks of ageing, PDS lost about 99% of its initial mechanical resistance, Creos(®) about 66%, Bio-Gide(®) about 30%, and Smartbrane(®) about 95%. After 3 weeks the mechanical resistance in all groups was significantly less than the initial values (p=0.05), but there was no difference between samples aged artificially for 6 compared with 8 weeks. The mechanical resistance of the tested materials was not influenced by the presence of pores in a standard configuration and was in the appropriate range for moderate fractures of the orbital floor. We recommend further clinical investigations of collagen membranes modified with pores.
