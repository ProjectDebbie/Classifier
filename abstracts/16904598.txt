New meniscus repair technique for peripheral tears near the posterior tibial attachment of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.
We introduce a suture technique to repair a peripheral tear near the posterior tibial attachment of the posterior horn. A suture hook was inserted through the posteromedial portal, and the peripheral capsular rim was penetrated from superior to inferior by the sharp hook. Both relay limbs were brought out through the posteromedial portal. The outer limb of the superior peripheral capsular rim was identified with a hemostat. An 18-gauge spinal needle loaded with a No. 0 polydioxanone suture (PDS) was introduced into the joint from the anteromedial portal; it was passed through the joint space until it penetrated the inner torn meniscus. The PDS suture loaded within the needle was pushed into the joint and picked up through the posteromedial portal. The needle was pulled out of the torn meniscus and readvanced over it while the suture was kept loaded. The other limb of the suture from the tip of the spinal needle was retrieved through the posteromedial portal. The initial PDS suture limb was hooked to the shuttle-relay system; it then was passed through the inner torn meniscus and the peripheral capsular rim. The suture limb exiting from the peripheral capsular rim was used as a post and was joined to the other suture limb to form a sliding knot.
