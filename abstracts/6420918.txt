Comparison between absorbable and nonabsorbable, monofilament sutures for end-to-end arterial anastomoses in growing pigs.
End-to-end anastomoses of the iliac arteries in growing pigs were constructed with interrupted 7-0 absorbable polydioxanone (PDS) or polypropylene (Prolene) sutures. Comparison between the two monofilament suture materials was made with respect to macroscopic and microscopic examinations, angiographic findings, recorded tensile breaking forces, and calculated blood flow values within the arterial walls at the level of the anastomoses. The angiographic examinations and the recorded tensile breaking forces did not reveal any difference between PDS- and Prolene-sutured anastomoses. On the other hand, the macroscopic findings, the histologic examination, and the calculated blood flow values (6.1 +/- 4.7 and 16.8 +/- 2.3 ml/min/100 gm for PDS- and Prolene-sutured anastomoses, respectively) point to a far more pronounced inflammatory tissue reaction with Prolene. The obtained differences clearly suggest the use of absorbable PDS instead of nonabsorbable Prolene sutures for arterial anastomoses.
