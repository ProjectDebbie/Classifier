A prospective randomized trial of suture material in aural wound closure.
The aim of the study was to compare synthetic monofilament suture materials with chromic catgut and silk in aural wound closure. Forty patients undergoing mastoidectomy or tympanoplasty were randomized to closure with either 3o PDS (Polydioxanone) to fascia plus 3o Prolene to skin, or 2o chromic catgut to fascia plus 3o silk to skin. Known or suspected factors affecting wound healing were recorded. Nine patients had post-operative wound infections. The infection rate was significantly lower in wounds closed with PDS and Prolene (chi 2 = 6.05, p less than .05), and in tympanoplasty operations (chi 2 = 4.42, p less than .05). Four patients suffered wound dehiscence, all four had been closed with catgut and silk. No other complication of wound healing was noted in the trial. In conclusion, PDS and Prolene are superior suture materials to catgut and silk in the closure of aural wounds.
