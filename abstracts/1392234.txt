Evaluation of an absorbable suture for sternal closure in pediatric cardiac surgery.
We conducted a study in a prospective fashion using 1-mm diameter absorbable sutures (polydioxanone [PDS]) for sternal closure in 50 consecutive patients, ages 5 months to 16 years, weighing 5 to 27 kg. Good wound closure and absence of any iatrogenic complications were noted. Potential benefits of this approach include disappearance of sequelae of the closure and better bone healing. This appears to be a safe alternative to standard sternotomy closure.
