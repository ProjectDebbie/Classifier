Suspension Threads.
Suture threads are a minimally invasive surgical technique for facial rejuvenation. Its use was initiated by Sulamanidze et al with propylene after Serdev introduced suture with polycaproamide; however, these types of suture increased inflammatory reaction. For correction of the aging face, surgeons are devising more procedures with fewer incisions and shorter postoperative recovery periods. Many of these procedures use absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures in the dermis and subcutis to lift lax skin. The polydioxanone suture is currently a great option for antiaging treatment, because besides the ease of applicability and good results, it also has a low incidence of adverse reactions.
