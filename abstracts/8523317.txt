Skin closure using nylon and polydioxanone: a comparison of results.
Nylon vertical mattress sutures and interrupted subcuticular polydioxanone (PDS) sutures have been used for skin closure. The complications and cosmetic results of each have been noted in a prospective trial of 93 hip wounds. When nylon sutures are used there is an increased incidence of erythema and the final scar is less cosmetically attractive. Interrupted PDS sutures take longer to insert but have few complications and are recommended in both the young and elderly patients.
