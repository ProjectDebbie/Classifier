Simplified arthroscopic suture passing using a suture loop.
Arthroscopic procedures for shoulder pathology are becoming more popular. Passing braided nonabsorbable suture for repair of intra-articular tissue can be technically difficult because advancing this suture through tissue is a 2-step process. The use of a suture loop with Spectrum suture hooks (Linvatec, Largo, FL) simplifies braided suture passing, and eliminates the use of expensive suture shuttles. This technique simplifies the use of nonabsorbable suture in arthroscopic shoulder procedures.
