In vitro comparison of mechanical and degradation properties of equivalent absorbable suture materials from two different manufacturers.
To compare the mechanical, knotting, and absorption properties of 3 synthetic absorbable suture materials (polyglactin 910, polydioxanone, poliglecaprone 25) from 2 different manufacturers (Huaiyin Medical Instruments Co. Ltd. and Ethicon Inc.). Suture material samples from the same manufacturing lot for each suture type and manufacturer. Part 1: 10 samples of each suture were incubated in bovine serum and tested for ultimate load and stiffness at days 0, 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Part 2: 10 knotted samples were similarly evaluated, without incubation. Huaiyin polydioxanone had a greater (P<.001) ultimate load on days 0, 1, and 7; and a consistently greater stiffness for the duration of the study, compared with the Ethicon polydioxanone. Ethicon poliglecaprone 25 had a greater ultimate load on days 0, 1, 7 (P<.001); on day 21 Huaiyin had a greater ultimate load. Ethicon poliglecaprone had greater stiffness on days 0, 1, 7 (P<.001). Ethicon polyglactin 910 had a greater (P<.001) ultimate load at all times and a greater stiffness (P<.001) at days 0, 1, 7, and 14 compared with Huaiyin polyglactin 910. Huaiyin polydioxanone and polyglactin 910 had greater knot breaking strengths than Ethicon equivalents (P<.001). Differences in mechanical properties exist between nominally identical suture materials from different manufacturers.
