Vascular anastomoses in growing vessels: the use of absorbable sutures.
Primary end-to-end infrarenal aortic anastomoses were performed in 36 piglets using two synthetic absorbable suture materials: polydioxanone and coated polyglactin. Animals were killed at 1, 4, and 11 weeks and 6 months following operation. Each aorta was removed, burst-tested to 300 mm Hg, radiographed, and examined  histologically. All anastomoses were patent, and no burst-test failures occurred. Stenosis occurred in 14 of 17 animals at 1 and 4 weeks, respectively. One of 5 animals exhibited stenosis at 11 weeks, and none of the 14 animals had stenosis 6 months postoperatively. Histological examination revealed fibrosis replacing areas of disrupted elastica at 6 months in both suture groups. This study suggests that absorbable suture material, in particular polydioxanone, because of its excellent handling characteristics and prolonged tensile strength retention, will be useful for the repair of vascular and cardiac anomalies where growth of the suture line is required.
