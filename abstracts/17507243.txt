Ease of tying arthroscopic knots.
To date, there is no comprehensive study that determines which arthroscopic knots are easiest to learn to tie. In this study, 23 surgeons in training graded 10 arthroscopic knots with regard to ease of learning and tying using a 10-cm visual analog scale for No. 2 Ethibond and No. 1 polydioxanone (PDS) II suture. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance and the Tukey Studentized range (HSD) test for post hoc analysis with a significant value of P < .05. The Tennessee slider, Duncan loop, Revo knot, and Nicky's knot were the easiest knots to tie by use of both Ethibond and PDS suture. The Field knot and double-twist knot were consistently the hardest knots to tie. Knots tied with Ethibond were easier to tie than knots tied with PDS. Novice surgeons should consider using the Revo knot when developing their arthroscopic knot-tying skills. Once they have mastered this knot, they can consider adding more difficult knots to their repertoire.
