Circumferentially oversewn inverted stapled anastomosis.
Leak rates of over 5% following anastomoses between the ileum and colon continue to be reported in large series and are associated with substantial morbidity and with mortality rates of 10-20%. In 1994, we began performing circumferentially oversewn inverted stapled anastomoses in patients undergoing ileo-colic anastomoses or ileostomy closure. It has become increasingly apparent that this method is associated with a low risk of leakage, which we should report. The anastomotic technique described was used in all patients undergoing ileo-colic anastomosis or closure of ileostomy by surgeon 1 (1994-2015) and in all ileo-colic anastomoses by surgeon 2 (2007-2015). All patients had a widely patent anastomosis constructed by two firings of a linear cutting stapler, as previously described. Additionally, the entire staple line was carefully oversewn with interrupted, inverting 4/0 polydioxanone sutures. Anastomotic leak was defined as a patient requiring re-operation or radiological drainage. One thousand and twelve patients underwent ileo-colic anastomosis and 685 patients underwent closure of ileostomy by surgeon 1, and 165 patients underwent ileo-colic anastomosis by surgeon 2. None of the 1862 patients required re-operation or radiological drainage for a leak (event rate 0%, 95% confidence interval 0-0.2%). However, there were three possible contained leaks treated successfully conservatively. The time taken to perform the actual anastomosis was measured in the last 30 ileo-colic resections. The median time was 42â€‰min. While this method may well be too slow to gain widespread adoption, we hope this report encourages increased research into finding techniques with similar low leak rates.
