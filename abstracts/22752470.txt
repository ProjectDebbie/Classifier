Treatment for unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer 2) with locking T-plate and additional PDS cerclage.
The purpose of the current study was to assess the clinical and radiological results after locking T-plate osteosynthesis with coracoclavicular augmentation of unstable and displaced distal clavicle fractures (Neer type 2). Thirty patients, treated between January 2007 and January 2010 were followed up after a median follow-up time of 12.2 months (range 4.7-37.2). The Constant and DASH scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcome, and anterior-posterior and 30° cephalic view radiographs were performed to assess the bony healing. In all patients, the fracture healing was achieved within the first 10 weeks after surgery. All patients regained good or excellent shoulder function and returned to previous occupation and activity levels. The mean Constant and DASH scores were 92.3 points and 6.2 points, respectively. We did not observe any severe intra- or post-operative complication within the time of follow-up. The presented technique turned out to be a reliable method providing good results without showing severe complications. Case series, Level IV.
