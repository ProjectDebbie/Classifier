Craniosynostosis: posterior two-third cranial vault reconstruction using bioresorbable plates and a PDS suture lattice in sagittal and lambdoid synostosis.
Beginning in 2004, we modified our surgical technique for a cranial vault remodeling in sagittal and lambdoid synostosis. Beginning in the early 1990s, we started using a calvarial vault remodeling technique in sagittal and lambdoid synostosis that involves removing the posterior two thirds of the skull, extending from the coronal suture to below the lambdoid suture to within 1-1.5 cm of the foramen magnum. Up until 2004, the bone fixation evolved from wire fixation, then micro-metallic fixation plates and resorbable sutures. Over the last 9 years, we have used a novel technique of absorbable fixation plates and a polydioxanone suture trellis or lattice network, which has reduced operating times significantly and continued to give excellent results. Additional advantages include the absence of a need for molding or protective helmets, the absence of bony defects at the completion of the procedure, the absence of age limitation, and the ability to correct the tightly constricted occiput. To date, we have had no significant complications, no return to operating room, and the aesthetics have held up well since its introduction.
