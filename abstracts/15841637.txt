Comparison of two absorbable monofilament polydioxanone threads in intradermal buried sutures.
Two absorbable polydioxanone threads are compared regarding intraoperative handling qualities, scar dehiscence, and possible side effects. In 30 excisions, half of each suture was performed with PDS II (Ethicon GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany), whereas the other half was closed with Serasynth (Serag-Wiessner, Naila, Germany). Clinical evaluation for scar spreading, spitting of the sutures, hypertrophic scarring, or suture granuloma was performed 3 and 6 months after surgery. No significant difference in scar spreading, hypertrophic scarring, or the incidence of suture granuloma was noted. A significantly lower frequency of spitting was seen with Serasynth than with PDS. The handling and suturing properties of SerasynthM were estimated to be slightly superior compared with those of PDS. Our study shows that PDS and Serasynth provide equal cosmetic results when applied in an appropriate suturing technique. Possibly owing to its better pliability, the frequency of spitting was lower with Serasynth.
