Reconstruction of orbital floor with polydioxanone plate.
The use of a polydioxanone (PDS) plate for orbital reconstruction was evaluated in 20 patients with various traumatic defects of the orbital floor. The follow-up time was 9 to 45 months (mean 20.4 months). A CT scan was obtained in 13 patients. Radiographic analysis showed that in 12 of the 13 patients there was new bone in the orbital floor. Clinically, most patients had transitory postoperative diplopia (lasting for a mean of 29 days) because of overcorrection. Only 2 patients, however, suffered from persistent diplopia. In one patient, abducens nerve paresis was the cause. It is concluded that PDS is suitable for orbital floor reconstruction, at least in cases in which defects do not exceed 1-2 cm in diameter. Overcorrection seems necessary. The material is well tolerated, is totally absorbed and appears to be replaced by bone in nearly all cases.
