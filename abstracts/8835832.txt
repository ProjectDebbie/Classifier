A method to reduce tension at the suture site.
Moderate-sized defects following injuries of peripheral nerves, like the median or ulnar, can be bridged instead of undergoing secondary repair with grafting, by primary or early secondary suturing using polydioxanon microbands (20 mm in length, 1 mm in width). Attached to the epineurium on both sides of the suture site, the bands help to reduce tension, thus reinforcing tensile strength. Early mobilization is possible. Primary or early secondary suturing is favored also in cases with defects up to 25 or even 30 mm, if the elasticity of the stumps permits sufficient elongation without hazard to the blood supply. Gaps of more than 30 mm require nerve grafting.
