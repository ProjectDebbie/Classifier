Comparison between absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures in arterial anastomoses in growing dogs.
Five dogs, 10 weeks old, underwent operation using ketamin-HCl anesthesia and end-to-end anastomoses of the femoral and brachial arteries were made using polyfilament nonabsorbable material (Ethibond), monofilament nonabsorbable material (Prolene), polyfilament absorbable material (Vicryl) and monofilament absorbable material (PDS). The arterial diameter using a micrometer and blood flow using an electromagnetic flow meter were determined. After six months another operation was performed and diameter and blood flow were measured again. No statistically significant differences were found between the different materials used with respect to growth related increases either in arterial diameter or blood flow.
