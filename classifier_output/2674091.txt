Autogenous lamellar corneal grafting in dogs.
Lamellar, autogenous, corneal grafts were performed on 9 clinically normal dogs (1 eye in each of 2 dogs and both eyes in each of 7 dogs) and 7 dogs with corneal disease (1 eye in each dog). Nylon, polyglycolic acid, polyglactin 910, and polydioxanone suture materials were used in 8-0 to 10-0 sizes. The eyes of the normal dogs were examined weekly for up to 16 weeks; corneal endothelium was reestablished in all eyes by 6 weeks after surgery. The eyes of the dogs with corneal disease were reexamined periodically for up to 9 months. Twenty-two of 23 (95.7%) grafts were considered successful in that they were translucent, and the dogs were able to see after surgery. The suture materials that caused the least tissue reaction were nylon and polyglactin 910. This procedure is indicated for chronic descemetoceles and other perforating corneal disease. It has the advantage of rapidly resolving severe corneal disease, with a high degree of success.
