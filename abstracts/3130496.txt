Polyglactin 910/polydioxanone bicomponent totally resorbable vascular prostheses.
Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that bioresorbable vascular prostheses woven from lactide-glycolide copolymers and implanted into arteries of several animal models become replaced by cellular tissues; the rate of replacement parallels the kinetics of prosthetic resorption. This study evaluates the efficacy of bicomponent resorbable prostheses as a method of augmenting resistance to dilatation during the resorption period of the more rapidly resorbed component. Bicomponent prostheses (n = 37) were woven from compound yarns containing 74% polyglactin 910 (PG910) and 26% polydioxanone (PDS) and were interposed into adult white New Zealand rabbit infrarenal aortas. Resultant prosthesis-tissue complexes were harvested after 2 weeks to 12 months. Specimens were photographed and sectioned for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Randomly selected fresh explants at 1 and 3 months and control aortic segments from the same rabbits were simultaneously perfused with culture media (37 degrees C, 100/80 mm Hg, 60 ml/min) and perfusates assayed by means of tritiated radioimmunoassay techniques for the stable prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha before and after the addition of sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) to the media.  showed 100% patency, no aneurysms, and stenosis in 1 of 37 prostheses (3%). PG910 was totally resorbed by 2 months and PDS by 6 months. By 1 month inner capsule thickness was 303 +/- 30 microns. In contrast to previous reports this was significantly thicker than that within 100% PDS (230 +/- 40 microns) and significantly less thick than in 100% PG910 (530 +/- 62 microns). Inner capsules in all three groups stabilized at similar thicknesses (417 to 502 microns).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
