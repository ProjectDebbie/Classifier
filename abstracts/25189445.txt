Triple-step laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: midline suture closure supported by dorsal component separation and intraperitoneal onlay mesh reinforcement.
Incisional hernias remain a surgical challenge when balancing surgical morbidity, functional restoration, and risk of recurrence. Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) placement reduces postoperative wound infections and allows fast patient recovery. Yet, current IPOM techniques do not achieve closure of the midline hernia gap, thereby increasing the risk of persistent mesh bulging with poor abdominal wall function. We propose a novel triple-step hernia repair technique that includes tension-free midline reconstruction. It is achieved through laparoscopic dorsal component separation and laparoscopic suture closure of the midline with a 1.0 polydioxanone suture sling. Combining dorsal abdominal wall component separation, a midline closure with adequate suture strength, and IPOM reinforcement merges the benefits of open and laparoscopic hernia repair. This triple-step technique allows static and functional laparoscopic abdominal wall reconstruction.
