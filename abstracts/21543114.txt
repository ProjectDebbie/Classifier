Tissue-engineered bone formation using periosteal-derived cells and polydioxanone/pluronic F127 scaffold with pre-seeded adipose tissue-derived CD146 positive endothelial-like cells.
The aim of this study was to generate tissue-engineered bone formation using periosteal-derived cells seeded into a polydioxanone/pluronic F127 (PDO/Pluronic F127) scaffold with adipose tissue-derived CD146 positive endothelial-like cells. Considering the hematopoietic and mesenchymal phenotypes of adipose tissue-derived cells cultured in EBM-2 medium, CD146 positive adipose tissue-derived cells was sorted to purify more endothelial cells in characterization. These sorted cells were referred to as adipose tissue-derived CD146 positive endothelial-like cells. Periosteum is a good source of osteogenic cells for tissue-engineered bone formation. Periosteal-derived cells were found to have good osteogenic capacity in a PDO/Pluronic F127 scaffold, which could provide a suitable environment for the osteoblastic differentiation of these cells. Through the investigation of capillary-like tube formation on matrigel and the cellular proliferation of adipose tissue-derived CD146 positive endothelial-like cells cultured in different media conditions, we examined these cells could be cultured in EBM-2 with osteogenic induction factors. We also observed that the osteogenic activity of periosteal-derived cells could be good in EBM-2 with osteogenic induction factors, in the early period of culture. The experimental results obtained in the miniature pig model suggest that tissue-engineered bone formation using periosteal-derived cells and PDO/Pluronic F127 scaffold with pre-seeded adipose tissue-derived CD146 positive endothelial-like cells can be used to restore the bony defects of the maxillofacial region when used in clinics.
