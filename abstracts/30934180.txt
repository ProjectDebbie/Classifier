Feasibility of a polydioxanone plate as an adjuvant material in rhinoplasty in Asians.
Nasal framework-supporting procedures such as septal extension grafts, derotation grafts, and columellar strut grafts are usually required in rhinoplasty in Asian patients because the skin envelope is tight, but the nasal framework is small and weak. Autologous materials are preferred, but they have some limitations related to the amount that can be harvested and the frequency of use. Therefore, synthetic materials have been used to overcome these limitations. A total of 114 patients who received a polydioxanone (PDS) plate as an adjuvant material in rhinoplasty from September 2016 to August 2017 were retrospectively investigated. The PDS plate was used as to support the weak framework and to correct the contour of the alar cartilages. The PDS plate was used for reinforcement of columellar struts and septal L-struts, alar cartilage push-down grafts, fixation of septal extension grafts, and correction of alar contour deformities. Primary and secondary rhinoplasty was performed in 103 and 11 patients, respectively. Clinically, no significant inflammation occurred, but decreased projection of the tip was observed in seven patients and relapse of a short nose was noted in five patients. PDS plates have been used in the United States and Europe for more than 10 years to provide a scaffold for the nasal framework. These plates can provide reinforcement to columellar struts, L-struts, and septal extension grafts. In addition, they can assist in deformity correction. Therefore, PDS plates can be considered a good adjuvant material for Asian patients with weak and small nasal cartilage.
