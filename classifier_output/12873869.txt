Influence of polydioxanone foil on growing septal cartilage after surgery in an animal model: new aspects of cartilage healing and regeneration (preliminary results).
To determine whether late complications after septoplasty in growing septal cartilage in children can be prevented by the use of a resorbable polydioxanone (PDS) foil in combination with the cartilage. Animal study with 45 young rabbits, operated on at the nasal septum. Four typical septoplasty procedures were carried out, including elevation of the mucoperichondrium, cartilage excision, and reimplantation of crushed and noncrushed cartilage; for each of the procedures, resorbable PDS foil was used in half of the animals. Observation time ranged from 2 weeks to 5 months, to observe the healing process until complete outgrowth of the septum and complete resorption of the foil were achieved. Ear, Nose, and Throat Department at University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary. Histomorphologic findings on specimens of septum stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff stains. Depending on the surgical procedure, there were various degrees of differences between the groups with and without PDS. After elevation of the mucoperichondrium, there were almost no differences between the 2 groups. After cartilage resection, reimplantation, and crushing, however, there was a remarkable difference between groups. In the group without PDS, septal deviations and poorly regenerated cartilage were observed, but in the group with PDS no significant deviation after complete regeneration of septal cartilage was observed. The resorbable PDS foil prevented a secondary deviation in the surgically treated growing septal cartilage in young rabbits. Use of this foil could reduce late complications such as septal deviations and possibly prevent growth inhibition in the growing nasal septum after septoplasty.
