Pyeloureterostomy or ureteroneocystostomy in renal transplantation?
A retrospective comparison of pyeloureterostomy and external ureteroneocystostomy as methods of reconstructing the urinary tract in 128 renal transplants is presented. There was one urological complication in 52 pyeloureterostomies (1.9%) compared with 4 in the 76 ureteroneocystostomies (5.3%). 6/0 Polydioxanone (PDS) is preferred to Prolene for the anastomosis because of possible calculus formation on the latter. Wound sepsis is commoner in pyeloureterostomies undergoing concomitant nephrectomy, despite prophylactic antibiotics, though this is not statistically significant and the overall sepsis rate is higher for ureteroneocystostomy. Nephrectomy was avoided in 17 selected cases by simply ligating the recipient ureter where the pre-transplant urine output was low. Two of these patients developed hydronephrosis in the isolated kidney and required later nephrectomy.
