Esophagotomy closure in the dog. A comparison of a double-layer appositional and two single-layer appositional techniques.
Esophagotomies were performed on 36 dogs and closed with 3-0 polydioxanone in double-layer simple interrupted, single-layer simple interrupted, or single-layer simple continuous patterns. The operative time was shortest for single-layer simple continuous closure, followed by single-layer simple interrupted and double-layer simple interrupted, respectively. Three dogs with each suture pattern were euthanatized at hours 0 and 1, and days 4 and 28 after surgery. The esophagotomy incisions were subjected to bursting strength testing and examined microscopically. The bursting wall tension was higher for all three suture pattern groups at 28 days than at 0 and 1 hour. The double-layer closure had higher bursting wall tension than the single-layer closures at 0 hour and 4 days. Single-layer simple continuous closure had the lowest bursting wall tension for each time period. Single-layer simple interrupted closure had the highest bursting wall tension at 28 days. Microscopic examination revealed close approximation of tissue planes for the double-layer closure and mucosal eversion for the simple interrupted and simple continuous single-layer closures. Healing was superior histologically with the double-layer closure.
