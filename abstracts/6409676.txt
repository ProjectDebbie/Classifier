Histologic reaction to four synthetic microsutures in the rabbit.
Histologic reaction to nylon, polypropylene, polyglactin-910, and polydioxanone microsutures was assessed in the uterine horn of the rabbit. At 24 days after insertion of the microsuture, a marked infiltration of histiocytes was seen around the nylon, polypropylene, and polydioxanone microsutures, whereas the reaction to polyglactin-910 was characterized by the presence of giant cells. At 80 days after insertion of the microsutures, the polydioxanone was almost entirely absorbed and the reaction to polyglactin-910 was minimal. Moderate histiocytic infiltration persisted around the nylon and polypropylene sutures. Fibrosis was also detected around the nylon and polypropylene sutures at 80 days, but not at all around the polydioxanone and polyglactin-910 sutures. We conclude that polydioxanone leaves little or no tissue reaction at 80 days in the uterine horn of the rabbit.
