 of dorsal midline plication in children with penile curvature and hypospadias.
To present our initial results using dorsal midline (12-o'clock position) plication in children with penile curvature and hypospadias. Twenty-five children with hypospadias and ventral curvature confirmed after artificial erection underwent dorsal midline plication and hypospadias repair. Ventral curvature was corrected by making a 5 to 10-mm-long vertical incision through the tunica albuginea at the dorsal midline and approximating the outer edges of the incision with a monofilament polydioxanone stitch. One plication suture was needed in 15 patients. In 8 patients with mid-shaft hypospadias and 2 with proximal penile hypospadias, two and three sutures were needed, respectively. In none of the patients was division of the urethral plate needed, except for one with proximal hypospadias. No complications were encountered during a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 5 to 34). We believe that most cases of penile curvature with hypospadias can be corrected using dorsal midline plication of the tunica albuginea. Although long-term follow-up is necessary after puberty to confirm any erectile or sensory advantage, this approach might be considered whenever plication is to be performed.
