Tissue reaction to suture material in the feline linea alba. A retrospective, prospective, and histologic study.
Swelling and inflammation along the incision line were observed after elective ovariohysterectomy in 22 of 66 cats in a retrospective study. In a prospective study of 99 feline abdominal incisions closed with surgical gut, polyglactin 910, or polydioxanone, with and without subcutaneous closure, the least inflammation occurred when the linea alba was sutured with polyglactin 910 and the subcutaneous tissues were not sutured. Histologically, reactions in the linea alba of 12 other cats progressed from purulent to fibromononuclear to fibrous within 14 days after closure with gut, polyglactin 910, and polydioxanone. Microscopic evidence of seroma formation in 9 of 12 animals in which the subcutaneous tissue was not sutured suggested that surgical closure of subcutaneous dead space was indicated. The inflammatory reaction did not appear to be related to any one suture material as reactions were seen with all of them.
