Reinforced staple line in severely emphysematous lungs.
In severely emphysematous or otherwise destroyed lung parenchyma, staples often cut through, which causes prolonged postoperative air leakage. A mechanical suture line reinforced by a polydioxanone ribbon is a simple, safe, and effective method for closure of air leaks, resection, or biopsy in such cases.
