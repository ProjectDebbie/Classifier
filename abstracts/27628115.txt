Short-term results of robotic sacrocolpopexy using the Quill SRS bi-directional polydioxanone (PDO) suture.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the short-term success of robotic sacrocolpopexy using the Quill bi-directional polydioxanone (PDO) suture. This was a retrospective observation study of women undergoing robotic sacrocolpopexy performed by a single surgeon between May 2008 and August 2010. Pelvic organ prolapse was determined using the pelvic organ prolapse quantification scale (POP-Q). Baseline exam were performed preoperatively and scheduled at 6 weeks, 3 months, and yearly thereafter. Treatment success defined as a POP-Q measurement of point C that did not descend for more than one-half the total vaginal length and a measurement for point Ba that was less than -1. A total of 36 patients were eligible for enrolment in the study. The mean age was 70 years (range 49-86 years), and mean body mass index was 27 kg/m(2) (range 19-41 kg/m(2)). The mean interval follow-up was 166 days (median 116; range 34-772 days). Anatomic success was 92% (33/36). In the short term, the Quill SRS PDO suture provided sufficient fixation of an Amid type I polypropylene mesh to the vagina to result in excellent anatomic success with only rare complications.
