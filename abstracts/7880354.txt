Refixation of large chondral fragments on the weight-bearing area of the knee joint: a report of two cases.
In most cases of cartilage avulsion, the chondral fragments are severely damaged, and refixation is therefore impossible. We present two cases with large intact cartilage fragments from the weight-bearing area of the femoral condyle after patellar dislocation. We tried refixation using fibrin sealant (Tisseel-Kit, Immuno AG, Vienna, Austria) and polydioxanone-pins (Bio-fix-Pins, Miracon AB, Helsingborg, Sweden). At second look arthroscopy, we found only one third to one half of the defects healed. Due to these results, the refixation of chondral fragments without attached bone seems to be questionable.
