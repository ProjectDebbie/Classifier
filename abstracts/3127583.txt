Effects of bacterial infection on absorbable vascular ligating clips.
Electron microscopic observations of two implanted absorbable clips, Absolok and Lactomer, infected with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis, were carried out. An overgrowth of bacteria was observed over the entire surface of the clips. The mating surfaces of the Lactomer clips and the locking mechanisms of both types of clip were more heavily infected--that is, provided better support for bacterial growth--than other areas of the clips in the initial postimplantation period. However, with longer periods (up to seven days), the initial bacterial deposits developed into a thick, plaquelike layer. This layer appeared to restrict access to the surfaces such that the infected clips degraded at a much slower rate than did the noninfected clips, particularly Lactomer clips, on which little morphologic change was detectable seven days after implantation.
