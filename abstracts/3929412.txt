A clinical evaluation of absorbable polydioxanone ligating clips in abdominal and pelvic operations.
An absorbable vascular ligating clip made of polydioxanone polymer was evaluated in 44 patients who underwent abdominal and pelvic operations. These clips were used in place of conventional metallic clips primarily in performing pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The polydioxanone clips were found to be superior to the metallic clips in ease of clip loading to the applier, security of clips in the transfer to the surgeon and security of the clip in the applier when positioning to ligate vessels. The use of polydioxanone clips, which absorb within 210 days, may also lead to improved CAT or NMR imaging by precluding energy scatter which is known to occur with some metallic clips. Clip applier function, security on tissues ligated and clip visibility were equivalent to previous experience using metallic clips. Selection of proper clip size is important so that excessive amounts of tissue are not contained within the clip jaws which might prevent clip closure. No postoperative complications were noted in the use of these clips.
