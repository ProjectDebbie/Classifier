Biodegradation of polydioxanone in bone tissue: effect on the epiphyseal plate in immature rabbits.
Implants of polydioxanone (PDS), 1.3 mm in diameter, were operatively fixed in the juxta-epiphyseal area of the right proximal tibial metaphysis in six rabbits and were driven into a drill hole of equal bore through the right proximal tibial epiphyseal plate in ten rabbits. The PDS implants had biodegraded almost completely in cortical bone at 16 weeks without any significant sign of inflammation or foreign body reaction. The PDS implants did not cause any growth disturbance. Histologic studies, however, showed that seven of 10 rabbits demonstrated significant osseous bridge formation across the epiphyseal plate.
