An in vivo microfabricated scaffold for tendon repair.
A new type of in vivo tissue engineering system for tendon repair in situ after cut or crush of a flexor tendon is described. The system is based on the topographical reaction, alignment, migration and perhaps proliferation of tendon cells on micrometrically grooved substrates made in a biodegradable polymer. Macrophage trapping in the structure may also help to prevent inflammation. Tendon damage including crush and section injury is a fairly frequent occurrence. The conventional treatment is surgical repair, however frequently this leads, especially in hand wounds, to attachment of the tendon surface to the surrounding synovium, which is very undesirable. We present an approach based on using a biodegradable device to ensure that the healing of severed or crushed flexor tendons is aided, synovial adhesion prevented and the final result anatomically correct. The biodegradable sheath carries microgrooves fabricated into the polymer by embossing that orient and guide the cells towards each other from either side of the region of damage. After six weeks an apparently normal functional tendon is reformed.
