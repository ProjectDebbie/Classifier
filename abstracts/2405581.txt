Strength characteristics and failure modes of locking-loop and three-loop pulley suture patterns in equine tendons.
Size 3-0 polydioxanone was used as a single strand, single braid (3 strands), or double braid (6 strands) to create six suture material-pattern combinations for equine tenorrhaphy: single-strand locking loop, single-braid locking loop, double-braid locking loop, single-strand three-loop pulley, single-braid three-loop pulley, and double-braid three-loop pulley. Maximum load to failure for the single-strand locking loop (46.1 +/- 2.9 newtons [N]) was less than for all other sutures (range, 103-155 N). The load required to form a 2 mm gap between tendon ends was greater for the single-braid three-loop pulley (66.7 +/- 6.9 N) and double-braid three-loop pulley (85.4 +/- 17.7 N) than any other sutures. The load required to produce a 10 mm gap was least for the single-strand locking loop (34.3 +/- 3.9 N) and greatest for the double-braid three-loop pulley (131.5 +/- 27.5 N). Gap between tendon ends at maximum load was greater for the single-braid (18.1 +/- 0.9 mm) and double-braid (19.2 +/- 2.2 mm) locking loops than for any other sutures. Suture material broke in 53% of the locking-loop tests but in only 17% of the three-loop pulley tests. Tendon matrix disruption accounted for 43% of the locking-loop failures and 77% of the three-loop pulley failures. The three-loop pulley pattern provided more support, less tendon distraction, and less tendon matrix constriction and distortion than the locking-loop pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
