Biomechanical comparison of reconstruction techniques for disruption of the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments.
Injuries to the acromioclavicular joint are common. For selected injuries, operative reconstruction is recommended. The purpose of the current study was to compare three reconstruction procedures: (1) nine strands of woven polydioxanonsulphate (PDS II) suture passed through the clavicle and around the coracoid; (2) procedure No. 1 with 50% of the coracoacromioclavicular ligament placed through 2 clavicular drill holes; (3) No. 5 Merselene tape passed through 2 drill holes in the clavicle and acromion, with 50% of the coracoacromial ligament transferred to the clavicle. Fourteen fresh frozen human shoulders were tested using a 6 degree-of-freedom testing device. The intact shoulder showed significantly less displacement than any of the reconstructions. Merselene tape plus ligament showed the largest displacement, and PDS II braid plus ligament showed the least displacement. None of the procedures reconstituted acromioclavicular joint stiffness to intact state levels, though improved acromioclavicular joint stiffness was noted with a PDS braid plus ligament.
