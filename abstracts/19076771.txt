Management of equine skull fractures using fixation with polydioxanone sutures.
Ten horses presented with severe distortion of the facial contour, crepitus on palpation and mild to moderate epistaxis. Individual horses also showed ocular damage, ptosis, severe dyspnoea and movement of the facial bones concurrent with respiration. The fracture fragments were exposed using a large curvilinear incision and elevated using a retractor, periosteal elevator, chisel or Steinmann pin. The fracture fragments were unstable following reduction and fixation was necessary. Stabilisation was achieved with polydioxanone sutures placed through holes drilled in opposing sides of the fracture lines. Polydioxanone sutures provided good stability and had better handling properties than wire. There was good apposition of fracture edges and minimal complications. Use of polydioxanone sutures can also avoid the expense and complexity of plate fixation in selected cases, and should be considered as an alternative to fixation with stainless steel wire in any facial fracture that adjoins stable bone.
