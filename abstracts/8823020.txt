Comparison of polydioxanone and polyglactin 910 in intradermal repair.
A prospective clinical study was undertaken to compare the results of intradermal layer closure using two popular absorbable suture materials, polydioxanone and polyglactin 910. On an alternating basis, 6-0 polydioxanone and 6-0 polyglactin 910 were used to repair 80 surgical sites of the temple and occipital regions in 20 patients undergoing facial rhytidectomy. In all instances, the superficial skin layer was repaired with 6-0 plain catgut. These sites were evaluated by a double-blind method for erythema, induration, infection, scar spread, and hypertrophic scarring at approximately 5 months and at least 1 year postoperatively. Scar spread was indicated at widths greater than 1 mm. Any raised scar was labeled hypertrophic. Scar spread, as defined above, was observed in 6 of 38 incisions repaired with polyglactin 910, and 3 sites developed scar hypertrophy. Conversely, 3 of 38 incisions closed with polydioxanone revealed scar spread (p < 0.25), and 3 were hypertrophic (p < 0.35). Sixty-one sites healed with undiscernible scars. This study does not disclose any statistically significant difference in the quality of the scars when polyglactin 910 is used compared with polydioxanone.
