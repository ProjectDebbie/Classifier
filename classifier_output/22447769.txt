Electrospinning adipose tissue-derived extracellular matrix for adipose stem cell culture.
Basement membrane-rich extracellular matrices, particularly murine sarcoma-derived Matrigel, play important roles in regenerative medicine research, exhibiting marked cellular responses in vitro and in vivo, although with limited clinical applications. We find that a human-derived matrix from lipoaspirate fat, a tissue rich in basement membrane components, can be fabricated by electrospinning and used to support cell culture. We describe practical applications and purification of extracellular matrix (ECM) from adipose tissue (At-ECM) and its use in electrospinning scaffolds and adipose stem cell (ASC) culture. The matrix composition of this purified and electrospun At-ECM was assessed histochemically for basement membrane, connective tissue, collagen, elastic fibers/elastin, glycoprotein, and proteoglycans. Each histochemical stain was positive in fat tissue, purified At-ECM, and electrospun At-ECM, and to some extent positive in a 10:90 blend with polydioxanone (PDO). We also show that electrospun At-ECM, alone and blended with PDO, supports ASC attachment and growth, suggesting that electrospun At-ECM scaffolds support ASC cultivation. These studies show that At-ECM can be isolated and electrospun as a basement membrane-rich tissue engineering matrix capable of supporting stem cells, providing the groundwork for an array of future regenerative medicine advances.
