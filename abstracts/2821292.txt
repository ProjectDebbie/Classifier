In vitro comparison of the properties of polydioxanone, polyglycolic acid and catgut sutures in sterile and infected urine.
The effect of immersion in sterile urine, infected urine and plasma on the breaking strength and stiffness of polydioxanone (PDS), polyglycolic acid (PGA) and chromic catgut was studied. Tests were done under closely controlled conditions with immersion periods varying from zero to ten days. The breaking strength and stiffness of the three suture materials was not significantly changed by immersion in plasma for periods up to ten days. In sterile urine, PDS lost all of its strength after three days of immersion while PGA lost 64% of its initial breaking strength after ten days. Catgut maintained its strength over the ten day study period. In E. coli-infected urine, PDS lost all of its strength in six days while PGA lost 71% and catgut 8% after ten days. In proteus-infected urine, PDS and PGA lost all their breaking strength after one day of immersion while catgut lost 5.8% of its initial strength after 10 days. Corresponding decreases in stiffness were also observed.
