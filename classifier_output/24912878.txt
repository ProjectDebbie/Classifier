Polydioxanone biodegradable stent placement in a canine urethral model: analysis of inflammatory reaction and biodegradation.
To investigate the inflammatory reaction and perform quantitative analysis of biodegradation after placement of a polydioxanone (PDO) biodegradable stent in a canine urethral model. PDO biodegradable stents were placed in the proximal and distal urethra of nine male mongrel dogs. The dogs were euthanized 4 weeks (group A; n = 3), 8 weeks (group B; n = 3), or 12 weeks (group C; n = 3) after stent placement. The luminal diameter of the stent-implanted urethra was assessed by follow-up retrograde urethrography, and histologic findings were obtained after the dogs were killed. Stents were removed after euthanasia, and their surface morphology and molecular weight were evaluated. Hematologic examination was performed to evaluate inflammatory reaction. Stent placement was technically successful in all dogs. The average luminal diameter gradually decreased. The average number of epithelial layers (2.93 vs 4.42; P < .001), the average thickness of papillary projection (0.80 mm vs 1.28 mm; P < .001), and the average thickness of submucosal fibrosis (0.34 mm vs 0.49 mm ; P < .001) were significantly increased in group B versus group A. There were no significant differences between group B and group C. The average inflammatory cell infiltration did not differ significantly in the three groups. Molecular weight losses were 54% in group A and 84% in group B. In group C, PDO stents were completely decomposed. An experimental study in a canine urethral model has demonstrated acceptable inflammatory reaction with gradually increasing granulation tissue but no luminal obstruction within 12 weeks.
