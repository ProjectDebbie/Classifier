Enhanced Differentiation of Human Preosteoblasts on Electrospun Blend Fiber Mats of Polydioxanone and Anionic Sulfated Polysaccharides.
The viability and differentiation of SaOS-2 preosteoblasts on fiber mats of blends comprising of the biodegradable poly(ester-ether) polydioxanone (PDX) and the sulfate-containing anionic polysaccharides kappa-carrageenan (KCG) and fucoidan (FUC) were investigated for a range of different blend compositions. The detailed analysis of the blend nanofiber properties revealed a different degree of miscibility of PDX and the polysaccharide leading to a different enrichment at the surface of the blend nanofibers, which were observed to be stable in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for up to 5 weeks. The fibrous mats of PDX/FUC led to the highest osteogenic differentiation with very good cell viability. The electrospun blend fibers also supported human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and iPS cell-derived embryoid bodies with high cell viability, which underlines the potential of these novel blend fiber systems for optimized performance in bone tissue engineering applications.
