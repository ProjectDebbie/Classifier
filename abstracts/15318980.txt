Biliopancreatic diversion with transitory gastric restriction and duodenal bulb preservation: 88 patients since 1992.
Over 10 years, 88 patients underwent biliopancreatic diversion with transitory gastric restriction (BPD-TGR) as a first choice operation or after gastric restrictive procedures. From 1992 to 1999, BPD-TGR was performed on 71 patients as a first choice operation (Group 1 - BMI 41.9 +/- 6.5). The TGR was achieved by a polydioxanone (PDS) band. The duodenal bulb was maintained to 5 cm distal to the pylorus, constructing an end-to-side antecolic isoperistaltic duodeno-ileal anastomosis. Since 1993, a further 17 patients underwent BPD-TGR as a correction for restrictive procedures (Group 2 - BMI 37.4, range 27.2-61.0).  in weight loss in Group 1 were similar to those in our previous classical BPD. Percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was 68.0 +/- 18.4, 75.9 +/- 12.3, and 75.4 +/- 12.0 at 1,5 and 10 years respectively. No patient had severe dysproteinemia (only 3% of patients had hypoalbuminemia of 3.0-3.4 g/dl). There was no case of diarrhea or halitosis. Anastomotic ulcers occurred in 2% of the patients. In Group 2, the patients had weight loss already present from the first operation, which continued after BPD-TGR with great variability from patient to patient. %EWL was 35.1 (range 0 to 72.5) and 35.2 (range 18.4 to 43.2) at 1 and 5 years. BPD-TGR appears to be an effective operation with few complications and also a satisfactory correction for failed gastric restrictive procedures, or even a sequential operation in the super-obese.
