A randomised controlled trial evaluating the use of polyglactin mesh, polydioxanone and polyglactin sutures for pelvic organ prolapse surgery.
To compare the effectiveness of polyglactin mesh, and polydioxanone or polyglactin sutures in women having pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Randomised controlled trial with a factorial 2(2 design of polyglactin mesh or not, and polydioxanone or polyglactin suture. Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires at baseline and on the third day and at 6 months after surgery. Women were also examined clinically 3 months after surgery. The primary outcome was the subjective improvement in prolapse symptoms and quality of life scores from baseline to 6 months. There was a subjective improvement in the prolapse symptom score from baseline to 6 months after surgery (mean difference of 9.2 (95% CI for difference 7.2-11.2, p < 0.001) and an improvement in the mean quality of life score over the same period with a reduction of 3.4 (95% CI for difference 2.4-4.3, p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the mean difference in prolapse symptoms and quality of life (QoL) scores according to the randomised groups. The majority (86%) of women were satisfied with their surgery. Our study demonstrated that at short-term follow-up, there was no significant difference in the mean differences in prolapse symptoms and QoL scores after surgery using polyglactin mesh or not, polyglactin or polyglactin sutures, but the numbers were too small for a definitive conclusion. Longer-term follow-up and/or a larger trial are required.
