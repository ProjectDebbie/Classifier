Arthroscopic Transtendinous Biceps Tenodesis With All-Suture Anchor.
There are several methods for long head of the biceps (LHB) tenodesis, yet the optimal option is still debatable. Here we introduce a technique for arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis with an all-suture anchor, the transtendinous biceps tenodesis technique. The LHB tenodesis is performed by using the Y-Knot anchor (1.3-mm). A standard suprapectoral approach is used for the tenodesis. A 1.3-mm drill bit is used to drill through the midportion of the biceps tendon and underlying bone to make a pilot hole. Next, the Y-Knot anchor is passed through the tendon and anchored on the underlying bone. A wrapping suture technique is then used to wrap around, tension, and secure the LHB tendon with the aid of a shuttling polydioxanone suture. The construct is fixed by tying down both suture limbs in a nonsliding fashion. This Technical Note describes an alternative method for all-arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis using an all-suture anchor with a small diameter to minimize trauma to the tendon.
