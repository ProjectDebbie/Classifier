A new spacing material for interstitial implantation of radioactive seeds.
Poly-p-dioxanon sutures (PDS) have been common in surgery as an absorbable material for years. After hardening by a particular procedure we use PDS pins as spacer material in interstitial I-125 implantations. The advantages of PDS are the mechanical qualities in contrast to catgut which causes hazards because of its soft consistency. PDS supports the efforts in optimization of seed distribution and dose application in interstitial radiotherapy.
