The effect of six knotting methods on the biomechanical properties of three large diameter absorbable suture materials.
To evaluate the effect of 6 different knotting methods on the mechanical properties of 3 large absorbable suture materials used in large animal surgery. In vitro mechanical study. Sample Population- Knotted suture loops (n=15 per group). Suture loops were created between two low-friction pulleys with either 2 polydioxanone, 2 polyglactin 910 or 3 polyglactin 910. Strands were tied using 1 of 6 knotting technique: square knot, surgeon knot, clamped surgeon's knot, sliding half-hitch knot (HH), Delimar knot and self-locking knot (SLK). A single cycle to failure test was performed on each suture loop with a distraction rate of 100 mm/min. Failure modes were evaluated and breaking strength, elongation to failure and stiffness were compared. All loops except two HH failed at the knot by acute breaking. The double-stranded SLK was both stronger and stiffer than all other knots for each suture material. Clamping the first throw of the surgeon knot decreased load to failure significantly (143.11 +/- 8.64 N) compared with not clamping (159.21 +/- 6.14 N) for polydioxanone. Stiffness and elongation to failure were respectively lower and increased for 2 polydioxanone compared with both polyglactin 910 materials for all knotting techniques. Knotting techniques do influence structural properties of suture loops. The double strand loop conferred stiffer and stronger properties to the SLK  Clamping the first throw of polydioxanone should be avoided when tying a suture under tension even using large diameter suture materials. Using a SLK might be considered as a useful alternative when excessive tension is present.
