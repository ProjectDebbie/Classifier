Minimally invasive coracoclavicular ligament augmentation with a flip button/polydioxanone repair for treatment of total acromioclavicular joint dislocation.
Treatment of complete acromioclavicular joint disruption remains controversial and ranges from rehabilitation to extensive surgical reconstruction. However, high-grade injuries (type IV, V, and VI) are typically treated surgically. Most reconstruction techniques addressing these injuries selectively focus on coracoclavicular ligament augmentation because it has been shown to be the primary stabilizer of the acromioclavicular joint. The conventional coracoclavicular polydioxanone (PDS) loop, which is widely performed, has been detected to have some pivotal disadvantages, including anterior subluxation of the clavicle, extensive preparation of the coracoid, and bony avulsion of the clavicle as a result of rotational clavicle movement. Therefore we present an augmentation technique that reduces these complications by replicating the orientation of the native coracoclavicular ligament complex and providing a minimally invasive subcoracoid and clavicular fixation of a double PDS loop by use of 2 flip buttons, typically used for extracortical anterior cruciate ligament graft fixation. The key step of the procedure includes the anatomic, secure, and stable placement of the double PDS cerclage under the coracoid base transferring a flip button through a coracoid bone tunnel. Our clinical experience shows that the presented technique is easy to perform and has a comparable invasiveness to recently presented arthroscopic techniques.
