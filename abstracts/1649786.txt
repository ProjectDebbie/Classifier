Chevron osteotomy fixed with absorbable polyglycolide pins.
Seventy-eight chevron osteotomies augmented by internal fixation with self-reinforced polyglycolide pins, 2 mm in diameter, were performed in 60 patients suffering from a painful hallux valgus. The mean metatarsophalangeal angle was 31 degrees, and there was a metatarsus primus varus varying from 10 degrees to 20 degrees. The average follow-up time was 14 (range, 12 to 31) months. No postoperative redisplacement or disturbance of healing of the osteotomy was observed, but recurrence of hallux valgus occurred in 8 feet (10%), each initially with a moderate to severe hallux valgus. Some pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint during physical activity remained in 12 feet (15%). There was a mean shortening of 2.5 mm of the first metatarsal bone, and the most significant shortening was associated with pain in the forefoot. The metatarsophalangeal joint motion was not decreased. The subjective overall result was excellent or good in 75% of the patients. Because of the biodegradability of the implants used, no secondary procedures to remove the implants were necessary.
