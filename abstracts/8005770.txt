Localized ridge augmentation using absorbable pins and e-PTFE barrier membranes: a new surgical technique. Case reports.
This paper presents a new surgical technique to promote bone formation in localized alveolar ridge defects. The objective was to regenerate sufficient bone volume for implant placement. The technique is dependent on careful defect debridement and the use of absorbable orthopedic pins, which serve as tent poles and prevent the e-PTFE barrier membranes from collapsing into the defects. The three defects treated with this technique were completely resolved with new bone, and implants were successfully placed into the augmented ridges. Biopsies from the treated sites revealed new bone formation.
