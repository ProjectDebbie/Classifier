Reattachment of the articular cartilage component of type 1 subchondral cystic lesions of the medial femoral condyle with polydioxanone pins in 3 horses.
3 horses were referred for treatment of subchondral cystic lesions of 1 or both medial femoral condyles. All horses had clinically apparent lameness confirmed to be due to a radiographically evident subchondral cystic lesion of the medial femoral condyle with a large articular component (> 15 mm) and shallow subchondral depth (< 10 mm). Arthroscopic assessment of affected cartilage revealed undulating cartilage with a relatively smooth surface and extensive residual perimeter attachment. Resorbable polydioxanone pins were used arthroscopically to reattach the cartilage overlying the subchondral cystic lesions. A biologic graft (bone marrow aspirate concentrate or allogeneic chondrocytes) was injected into the depths of the cystic cavity following cartilage reattachment. Follow-up examination confirmed radiographic resolution of the lesion and elimination of clinical signs within the treated femorotibial joint. Lesions with a large area of affected articular cartilage have been associated with a decreased rate of return to athletic function following arthroscopic debridement, likely secondary to the loss of subchondral architecture and the production of imperfect fibrocartilage repair. Salvage of the affected cartilage in a select population of horses with progressively expanding but shallow subchondral cystic lesions of the medial femoral condyle is possible and may improve radiographic and clinical outcome.
