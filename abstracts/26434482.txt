Primary Endoscopic Repair of a Large Tracheal Rupture Through Tracheal Stoma.
We describe the case of an 83-year-old man who presented with a large trauma to the membranous wall of the trachea and was treated with endoscopic primary repair of the tracheal wall through a preexisting tracheal stoma. Assessment with an optical telescope through the tracheal stoma revealed a 5-cm laceration in the membranous wall of the trachea starting immediately above the carina. The laceration was closed using continuous 4-0 monofilament polydioxanone sutures with direct visualization of tissues through a fiberoptic telescope. This approach is particularly effective in cases of traumatic rupture of the membranous trachea.
