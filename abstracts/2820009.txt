New absorbable synthetic explants for the treatment of retinal detachment.
The synthetic absorbable materials polyglicolic acid, (PGA) polyglactin (PG910), and polydioxanone (PDS) were used in various combinations in the repair of 82 eyes with retinal detachments. The latter two substances were tested in rabbit eyes and compared with fascia lata, catgut, and silicodesiccated sclera. The absorbable implants were well tolerated in all eyes. The PDS lasted the longest and produced a significant buckling effect for at least 6 months.
