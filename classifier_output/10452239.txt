Distribution and localization of cells and collagens in the proliferated intima of arterially implanted autovein grafts.
We examined the microscopic features and distribution of collagens in the hyperplastic intima of arterially implanted autovein bypass grafts under conditions of a reduced blood flow with a poor distal outflow. Vascular anastomosis was made using 7-0 nonabsorbable polypropylene sutures (PP group), or absorbable polydioxanone sutures (PDS group). On the contralateral limb, an autovein bypass graft was performed under normal flow conditions (NF group). The thickness of the intima in the NF group was approximately 50 microm throughout the duration of the study, while in the PP and PDS groups, intimal hyperplasia progressed to 290+/-112 microm and 267+/-123 microm, respectively, at 13 months after grafting. Collagen accumulated significantly in both the PP and PDS groups; types IV and V collagen in particular increased considerably in the deep layer. Regardless of the suture materials, the progression of intimal hyperplasia was considered to be closely related to the poor distal outflow to be and caused by the proliferation of myofibroblasts and active production of collagen. The increase in types IV and V collagen, particularly in the deep layer of the hyperplastic intima, was due to development of numerous vasa vasora in this region.
