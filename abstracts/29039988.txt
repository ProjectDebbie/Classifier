The intraoperative use of polydioxanone foil to reduce the risk of sino-orbital fistula formation in orbital exenteration.
Orbital exenteration is a radical surgical procedure resulting in deformity. It involves removal of the globe, optic nerve, extra-ocular muscles, orbital fat, lacrimal gland, and peri-osteum. Sino-orbital fistula (SOF) formation is a common documented post-operative complication, usually connecting the orbit and the ethmoid sinus. SOFs can cause leaks of serous fluid, and act as an entry site for pathogens into the orbit leading to socket infection and breakdown. This retrospective study analyzed exenterations performed over a 22-year period (1993-2015) at the National Ocular Oncology Service Centre for Scotland. PDS is a crystalline, biodegradable polyether-ester that is strong with good shape-memory and flexibility. Orbital exenterations with and without the use of PDS foil were compared in terms of SOF formation. A total of 30 exenterations were performed during the study period. A total of 29 were analyzed. Choroidal malignant melanoma was the most common indication for performing orbital exenteration (n = 7, 24.14%). The most common post-operative complications seen were SOF (n = 8, 27.59%). A total of 8 out 21 (38.10%) cases not using PDS developed SOFs. By contrast, none of nine patients receiving PDS plates developed SOFs (p = 0.0332). This is the first study to compare SOF rate in patients undergoing exenteration with and without the use of PDS foil. PDS foil is a safe material, which has effectively reduced the incidence of SOF formation.
