Tissue reactivity and degradation patterns of absorbable vascular ligating clips implanted in peritoneum and rectus fascia.
Absorbable vascular ligating clips are finding increasing use in intraabdominal surgery. We report the results of a light and scanning electron microscope investigation of the tissue reactivity and clip degradation patterns of two such materials, Absolok (polydioxanone) and Lactomer (copolymer of glycolic and lactic acid), implanted in the fascia and peritoneum of rabbits for intervals of 2 to 70 days. Cellular response to the clips, defined as the number of inflammatory cells/10(4) microns 2, was maximum at day 4 postimplantation, then gradually declined as the duration of implantation increased. This pattern, seen with both types of clips, was similar to that seen with polydioxanone (PDS) suture, but significantly greater than that associated with polypropylene (Prolene) suture. Although cellular response to the clips was greater in peritoneum than in fascia, especially on two occasions associated with adhesion formation, this was not statistically significant. Based on our morphological observations, the signs of clip degradation which were indicated by the appearance of surface crazing and cracks occurred earlier in peritoneum than in fascia.
