Small-diameter hybrid vascular grafts composed of polycaprolactone and polydioxanone fibers.
Electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) vascular grafts showed good mechanical properties and patency. However, the slow degradation of PCL limited vascular regeneration in the graft. Polydioxanone (PDS) is a biodegradable polymer with high mechanical strength and moderate degradation rate in vivo. In this study, a small-diameter hybrid vascular graft was prepared by co-electrospinning PCL and PDS fibers. The incorporation of PDS improves mechanical properties, hydrophilicity of the hybrid grafts compared to PCL grafts. The in vitro/vivo degradation assay showed that PDS fibers completely degraded within 12 weeks, which resulted in the increased pore size of PCL/PDS grafts. The healing characteristics of the hybrid grafts were evaluated by implantation in rat abdominal aorta replacement model for 1 and 3 months. Color Doppler ultrasound demonstrated PCL/PDS grafts had good patency, and did not show aneurysmal dilatation. Immunofluorescence staining showed the coverage of endothelial cells (ECs) was significantly enhanced in PCL/PDS grafts due to the improved surface hydrophilicity. The degradation of PDS fibers provided extra space, which facilitated vascular smooth muscle regeneration within PCL/PDS grafts. These results suggest that the hybrid PCL/PDS graft may be a promising candidate for the small-diameter vascular grafts.
