Orbital floor reconstruction with flexible Ethisorb patches: a retrospective long-term follow-up study.
The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a flexible, biodegradable material (Ethisorb) shows better long-term results with regard to diplopia, bulbus motility, and exophthalmos/enophthalmos compared to the use of lyophilized dura-patches and polydioxanone (PDS) foils. During a period of 6 years 435 patients with an orbital fracture were investigated retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were patients with fractures of the orbital floor with a maximum size of 2 x 2 cm. Bulbus motility, exophthalmos, enophthalmos, and diplopia were investigated during a period of 2 years. One hundred twenty orbital floors were reconstructed by lyophilized dura-patches, 81 by PDS, and 136 by Ethisorb. An exploration without an implantation was performed in 91 patients. The long-term investigation 12 to 15 months after surgery showed an exophthalmos and enophthalmos incidence of 1%, whereas a reduced bulbus motility and diplopia were found in 5% and 4%, respectively. Fifteen to 24 months after surgery 2% of the patients had an exophthalmos and 1% had an enophthalmos. A reduction of bulbus motility was found in 4% of the patients, and diplopia was found in 3%. The use of Ethisorb resulted in a significantly lower incidence of exophthalmos 3 months after surgery compared to PDS. The low rate of acquired bulbus motility demonstrates acceptable results in using Ethisorb in the floor of the orbit.
