Closure of nasal septal perforations with a polydioxanone plate and temporoparietal fascia in a closed approach.
Septal perforation closure is still often invasive and complex, with relatively low closure rates. We aimed to provide the first results of a case series of 20 patients with nasal septal perforations who underwent septal perforation repair by both an open and a minimally invasive technique by using a graft that consisted of temporoparietal fascia and a polydioxanone (PDS) plate without mucosal flaps. Between 2014 and 2016, we tested, for the first time, the feasibility of the insertion of this graft via a hemitransfixion incision at our institution. The rationale for the closed approach was to avoid any visible nasal scars. We reported our results of both approaches. The septal perforations were closed by insertion of a graft, which consisted of a 0.25-mm PDS flexible plate enveloped by temporoparietal fascia, into the perforation. The insertion of the graft was performed either via a columellar incision (open approach) or via a cosmetically advantageous hemitransfixion incision (closed approach) in an underlay technique. No attempts were made to close the perforation by mucosal flap rotation and/or advancement. Protective silastic sheeting to both sides of the perforation provided fixation to the graft while natural mucosal healing occurred over the perforation in the course of 3 to 8 weeks. Eighteen of 20 perforations were closed by mucosa at the last follow-up. The mean follow-up was 8.7 months. Thirteen patients had surgery via the closed approach. We showed, for the first time, that the insertion of a graft that consisted of a PDS flexible plate enveloped in temporoparietal fascia via a hemitransfixion incision was feasible and resulted in complete mucosal closure of nasal septal perforations in most patients. By performing the hemitransfixion incision, we avoided any visible nasal scars.
