Effects of different kinds of meshes on postoperative adhesion formation in the New Zealand White rabbit.
The aim of this study was to compare the effect of different kinds of surgical meshes on postoperative adhesion formation. Forty-two New Zealand White rabbits were studied. The rabbits were grouped into six groups, according to the type of surgical meshes (Prolene, Mersilene, Vypro, polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE), Proceed and control group) implanted into the peritoneum cavity. Thirty days after the operation, the relaparotomies were carried out, and any adhesions observed between the implanted mesh and tissues were evaluated and graded. The mean adhesion degree was 9.2 in the Mersilene mesh group, 9.5 in the Prolene mesh group, 9.7 and in the Vypro mesh group (P > 0.05). The mean adhesion degree was 1 in the control group, 2.75 in the Proceed mesh group and 2.25 in the PTFE mesh group. There was a significant difference in adhesion degree between the control, Proceed and PTFE groups and the Prolene, Mersilene and Vypro mesh groups. The adhesion degree was significantly lower in the Proceed and PTFE mesh groups when comparing them with the Prolene, Mersilene and Vypro meshes.
