Evaluation of three techniques for end-to end anastomosis of the small colon in horses.
In an attempt to determine the best method for surgical removal of devitalized small colon lesions, 12 horses underwent a double small colon resection and end-to-end anastomosis. In 4 horses (study 1), an appositional single-layer (APP-1) suture pattern was compared with an inverting 2-layer (INV-2) suture pattern. In 8 horses (study 2), an appositional 2-layer (APP-2) suture pattern was compared with the INV-2 suture technique. Polydioxanone suture (size 1-0), was used. Horses were evaluated at necropsy 3, 10, 14, 28, or 56 days after surgery. Postoperative complications (peritonitis, impaction, or excessive adhesions) were encountered in 100, 42, and 13% of the APP-1, INV-2, and APP-2 anastomoses, respectively. Postmortem evaluation of the small colon revealed dehiscence of the anastomotic site, diffuse peritonitis, and adhesion formation in 3 of the 4 horses in which the resection line was closed with the APP-1 pattern. With the INV-2 and APP-2 techniques, more intestinal inversion was present in the nontaenial than in the taenial portion of the small colon. More postoperative impactions were found with the INV-2 (n = 5) anastomoses than with the APP-2 (n = 1) technique; this appeared to be the result of excessive tissue inversion. There was no difference in lumen diameter between the INV-2 and the APP-2 techniques (P greater than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
