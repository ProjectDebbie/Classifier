First experience with biodegradable airway stents in children.
We here report our experience with biodegradable polydioxanone stents for tracheal narrowing in children. Eleven custom-made polydioxanone stents were implanted in 4 patients with airway narrowing due to external compression or intrinsic collapse. The median stent diameter was 9 mm (range, 6 to 14 mm) and median length was 15 mm (range, 13 to 70 mm). Narrowing was relieved initially in all cases. There was no bleeding or perforation after polydioxanone stent implantation. Size mismatching was a problem in 2 cases. Three patients needed repeat stenting after stent absorption. There was 1 death, unrelated to the stent implantation. All 3 survivors are in good clinical condition up to 12 months after first stenting. This pilot study shows that polydioxanone stents offer an alternative to metallic or silastic stents for collapse or external compression of the trachea in children. They may avoid the need for permanent stenting and allow subsequent growth of the airway.
