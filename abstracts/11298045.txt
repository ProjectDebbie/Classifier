Retroperitoneoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty for pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in infants and children.
To report our initial experience of endoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty through a retroperitoneal approach in infants and children with pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. Thirteen infants and children with PUJ obstruction underwent retroperitoneoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty (mean age at operation 2.7 years, range 0.25-10). Nine patients presented with complications secondary to PUJ obstruction, including urinary tract infection, pyonephrosis and increasing hydronephrosis with impairment in renal function. The other four patients had recurrent loin pain secondary to intermittent PUJ obstruction. The patient was placed in semi-prone (for left-sided) or a semilateral position (for right-sided PUJ obstruction). The retroperitoneal space was entered via a 1-cm incision over the mid-axillary line and further developed using a glove balloon. Video-retroperitoneoscopy was undertaken using a 5-mm laparoscope. Dismembered pyeloplasty was carried out with the pelvi-ureteric anastomosis fashioned using fine polydioxanone sutures over a double-pigtail ureteric stent. The retroperitoneoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty was successful in 12 patients, while one with previous percutaneous nephrostomy drainage for pyonephrosis required open conversion because of difficulties in developing the retroperitoneal space. The mean (range) operative duration was 143 (103-235) min. All patients had a rapid and uneventful recovery. The drainage was satisfactory in all 12 patients on a follow-up scan. Retroperitoneoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty is effective and safe in infants and young children giving a good early outcome, although the long-term results await further studies.
