Modified Caspari technique for traumatic anterior shoulder instability: comparison of absorbable sutures versus absorbable plus nonabsorbable sutures.
The efficacy of the Caspari technique using a combination of absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures was compared with that of using only absorbable sutures. Forty-four patients (45 shoulders) underwent our modified Caspari technique for traumatic anterior shoulder instability and were followed-up for 2 to 3 years postoperatively. The average age at operation was 22 years. Among 27 patients treated using all absorbable PDS sutures, 7 patients had recurrent instability (success rate, 74%). Among 18 patients treated using both PDS and nonabsorbable polypropylene sutures, only one showed apprehension after a direct blow to the shoulder sustained by falling from a height (success rate, 94%). The mean stability score according to Rowe's criteria was significantly higher in the combination of absorbable and nonabsorbable group (P = .0412). External rotation increased more slowly in the combination of absorbable and nonabsorbable group than in the absorbable group. The mean limitation of external rotation was 8.4 degrees and 2.7 degrees, respectively (P = .0129). The modified Caspari technique using both absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures achieved excellent stability according to Rowe's criteria and external rotation showed more gradual improvement compared to repair with absorbable sutures alone.
