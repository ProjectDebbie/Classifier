Feasibility study of sutureless distal coronary anastomoses with degradable Y-shunt and tissue adhesives in a porcine off-pump model.
The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of the combined use of intraluminal biodegradable shunts and surgical adhesives for sutureless distal coronary anastomosis. Eighteen LITA-LAD anastomoses were created in a porcine beating heart model. In group I (n=9) a custom-made silicone Y-shunt provided internal stability, while three different adhesives, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate-glue (CYAC); albumin-glutaraldehyde-glue (AG); fibrin-glue (FIB), were applied externally. In group II (n=9) biodegradable polydioxanone (PDS) shunts were used. All anastomoses were examined intraoperatively by flow measurement, blood leakage was quantified and physical strength was tested. In all pigs anastomoses could be created successfully at first attempt, but anastomotic leaks requiring additional sutures occurred in 6 animals. LITA-flow significantly decreased in both groups. A patency rate of 89.9% (8/9) was found in group I while it was 66.6% (5/9) in group II. The lowest amount of blood-loss was measured when CYAC adhesive was used while tensile strength was lowest in the FIB-anastomoses. Preliminarily we could demonstrate the feasibility of performing sutureless distal coronary anastomosis by means of a combination of adhesives and temporary intraluminal shunts. PDS-shunts, however, resulted in a high graft-occlusion rate, so that potentially less thrombotic materials need to be investigated.
