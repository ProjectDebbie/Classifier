Long-term drug delivery using implantable electrospun woven polymeric nanotextiles.
A woven nanotextile implant was developed and optimized for long-term continuous drug delivery for potential oncological applications. Electrospun polydioxanone (PDS) nanoyarns, which are twisted bundles of PDS nanofibres, were loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) and woven into nanotextiles of different packing densities. A mechanistic modeling of in vitro drug release proved that a combination of diffusion and matrix degradation controlled the slow PTX-release from a nanoyarn, emphasizing the role of nanostructure in modulating release kinetics. Woven nanotextiles, through variations in its packing density and thereby architecture, demonstrated tuneable PTX-release. In vivo PTX-release, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were evaluated in healthy BALB/c mice by suturing the nanotextile to peritoneal wall. The slow and metronomic PTX-release for 60 days from the loosely woven implant was extremely effective in enhancing its residence in peritoneum, in contrast to intraperitoneal injections. Such an implantable matrix offers a novel platform for therapy of solid tumors over prolonged durations.
