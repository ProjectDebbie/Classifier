Running closure of clean and contaminated abdominal wounds using a synthetic monofilament absorbable looped suture.
The effectiveness of using an absorbable suture material for continuous closure of abdominal wounds, especially contaminated wounds, has not yet been determined. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the wound complications that developed following continuous closure of clean and contaminated abdominal wounds using polydioxanone (PDS), compared with those that developed following interrupted closure using braided silk. Running closure using PDS was performed in 152 patients (PDS group), while 280 patients who underwent interrupted closure using braided silk served as controls (SILK group). The occurrence rates of wound dehiscence, early wound infection, and incisional hernia did not differ significantly between the two groups; however, the incidence of late suture sinus formation in the PDS group (1.3%) was significantly lower than that in the SILK group (7.1%). Moreover, late suture sinus formation following PDS suturing healed within 1 week after percutaneous drainage alone without removal of suture strings, whereas late suture sinus following braided silk suturing took an average of 16 days to heal and required removal of the infected suture strings in all 20 patients. These findings indicate the potential usefulness of PDS as a suture material to achieve running closure of clean or contaminated abdominal wounds.
