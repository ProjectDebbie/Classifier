Mechanical comparison of median sternotomy closure in dogs using polydioxanone and wire sutures.
To compare the mechanical properties of two different materials for canine median sternotomy closure. In vitro biomechanical study. Twelve canine cadaveric entire sternum and portion of associated ribs and musculature. Median sternotomy leaving the manubrium intact was closed using polydioxanone and stainless steel wire in a figure of eight pattern. Constructs were loaded in a servohydraulic material testing system and displacement was compared at loads of 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 N, and at failure. Displacement at loads up to 400 N and failure did not show any statistical difference between the polydioxanone and the stainless steel wire. However, the loading forces to create failure of the construct were superior for the stainless steel. Polydioxanone and stainless steel wire had the same response to distractive forces for loads applied up to 400 N. This study cannot recommend the use of polydioxanone over wires but suggests that polydioxanone can potentially be an alternative for primary median sternotomy closure in selected patients.
