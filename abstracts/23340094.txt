The influence of suture material on the strength of horizontal mattress suture configuration for meniscus repair.
Comparison of the mechanical characteristics of meniscal repair fixation using horizontal sutures and six different sutures under submaximal cyclic and load to failure test conditions may aid physicians in selecting a suture type. A 2-cm long anteroposterior vertical longitudinal incision was created in six groups of bovine medial menisci. Lesions were repaired using a No. 2 suture either composed of polyester or polyester and ultra high-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), or UHMWPE and polydioxanone or pure UHMWPE. Endpoints included ultimate failure load (N), pull-out stiffness (N/mm), pull-out displacement (mm), cyclic displacement (mm) after 100cycles, after 500cycles, and mode of failure. Polyester suture had lower ultimate load than all groups except the suture composed of polyester and UHMWPE (P<.05). Pure UHMWPE suture had higher ultimate failure load than sutures composed of either polyester or polyester plus UHMWPE (P<.05). Predominant failure mode was suture cutting through the meniscus for the groups except for polyester suture which failed by suture rupture. Under cyclic loading conditions in bovine meniscus, braided polyester suture fixation provided lower initial fixation strength than fixation with various high strength sutures composed of pure UHMWPE or a combination of absorbable monofilament polydioxanone and UHMWPE, except for combination of polyester and UHMWPE sutures. Present study does not support the usage of the braided polyester sutures instead of high strength sutures composed either partially or totally of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for the horizontal suture configuration of meniscus repair.
