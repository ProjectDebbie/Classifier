Platelet-rich plasma and alignment enhance myogenin via ERK mitogen activated protein kinase signaling.
Volumetric muscle loss is debilitating and involves extensive rehabilitation. One approach to accelerate healing, rehabilitation, and muscle function is to repair damaged skeletal muscle using regenerative medicine strategies. In sports medicine and orthopedics, a common clinical approach is to treat minor to severe musculoskeletal injuries with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections. While these types of treatments have become commonplace, there are limited data demonstrating their effectiveness. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of PRP on myoblast gene expression and protein production when incorporated into a polymer fiber. To test this, we generated extracellular matrix mimicking scaffolds using aligned polydioxanone (PDO) fibers containing lyophilized PRP (SmartPReP<sup>®</sup> 2, Harvest Technologies Corporation, Plymouth, MA). Scaffolds with PRP caused a dose-dependent increase in myogenin and myosin heavy chain but did not affect myogenic differentiation factor-1 (MyoD). Integrin α7β1D decreased and α5β1A did not change in response to PRP scaffolds. ERK inhibition decreased myogenin and increased Myod on the PDO-PRP scaffolds. Taken together, these data suggest that alignment and PRP produce a substrate-dependent, ERK-dependent, and dose-dependent effect on myogenic differentiation.
