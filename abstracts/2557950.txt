A comparison of scar quality in wounds closed under tension with PGA (Dexon) and Polydioxanone (PDS).
Wounds closed under tension have a tendency to stretch. To assess whether this stretching can be limited by inserting absorbable subcuticular sutures, 28 wounds, which involved elliptical excisions, were closed with PGA and PDS sutures in opposite halves of the same wound. PGA scars were found to be significantly wider than their PDS counterparts and were associated with greater hypertrophy at 6 months.
