Ventral laparoscopic abomasopexy on adult cows.
Displacement of the abomasum is frequently diagnosed by veterinarians in bovine practice and numerous surgical techniques have been developed to treat and prevent this condition. Complications secondary to those techniques are related to their degree of invasiveness and the development of postoperative wound infections. The objectives of this study were to describe a safe and reliable abomasopexy technique by laparoscopy and to assess postoperative adhesion formation. A ventral laparoscopic abomasopexy was performed on 10 adult dry cows. The abomasum was fixed with 4 simple interrupted sutures using USP 2 polydioxanone suture material. No major complications were encountered during the surgery. Abomasal adhesions were visually evaluated by laparoscopy 3 mo postoperatively. This technique proved to be simple and safe, and it provided adequate abomasum fixation in healthy dry cows. It could be used to surgically correct left displaced abomasum.
