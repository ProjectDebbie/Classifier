Construction of small-caliber, polydioxanone cyclohexanone vascular stents.
Objective of this article is to construct and characterize a three-layered small-caliber, artificial vascular stent. The outer layer of the stent consisted of small intestine submucosa (SIS), the middle layer was the polydioxanone (PDS) vascular stents, and the inner layer. The SIS and PDS were attached with 8-0 PDS thread. Crosslinking with a 10% collagen/chondroitin sulfate solution and 0.020% glutaraldehyde secured the structure. The stent was implanted into the muscles on both sides of the canines' spine at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. A MTT assay using L-929 cells measured the cytotoxicity of the implant. Histological and microscopy analyses were employed to examine the degradation characteristics of the PDS stent. Biomechanical properties of the stent were tested and compared to those of normal physiological blood vessels. The PDS stent burst pressure (43.5 +/- 8.3) kPa, rupture intensity (19.1 +/- 1.56) N, strain ratio (42.88 +/- 3.16)%, and radial compliance (5.96 +/- 0.87)%/100 mmHg were similar to that of physiological vessels. The cytotoxicity test showed that the PDS stent complied with specifications for biological materials for medical applications, with a cell toxicity ranging from 0 to 1. After 12 weeks, SIS and collagen sponge were completely replaced by fibrous connective tissue. Although there was some degradation of PDS, inflammatory cell infiltration subsided. After 24 weeks, the scaffold material began to absorb the new fibers and became filled with inflammatory cells and macrophages. This artificial vascular stent met the requirements of transplant experiments and should be further investigated for future clinical applications.
