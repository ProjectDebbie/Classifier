Interactions between osteoclastic cells and biodegradable polymers in vitro.
The use of implants to stabilize fractured diaphyseal bone, to handle difficult bone damage and to perform augmentation or replacement procedures in bone has become a common method in bone surgery.  In most cases metal implants were used. Biodegradability of implant materials offers new perspectives. Restoration of the physiological status in the implant site becomes possible.  Allergic reaction and second operations to remove the implants can be avoided and transitional aid in wound healing by the use of biomaterials can be achieved. An in-vitro system was established to investigate the interactions between osteoclasts and biomaterials, since it is the osteoclasts which are potentially able to resorb or degrade implants.  The cell's resorption capabilities as well as its morphological behavior were documented.  Two biodegradable and four nonbiodegradable materials were tested. The non-degradable materials provoked specific cell behaviour patterns but were not resorbed.  Fibrin tissue adhesive sealant, however, displayed resorption lacunae mediated by osteoclasts, whereas polydioxanone (PDS) showed no resorption sites but normal cellular morphology when compared to the standard control (cells on hydrophilic coated teflon dishes). Both materials appeared to be well accepted by osteoclasts. This test system was established for the valuation of biodegradable implant materials and can be used to characterize new materials concerning their resorbability and biocompatibility without superposition by other cell systems.
