Venous anastomosis by piggyback technique to avoid twisting of the pediatric en bloc kidney grafts.
This is the first report of using piggyback technique for the venous anastomosis in two pediatric recipients of small en bloc kidneys, which was found to be effective to avoid twisting of the grafts and vessels. The donors were aged 2 and 3 years with a body weight of 17 and 20 kg. The recipient age was 14 and 16 years with a body weight of 42 and 54 kg. The implantation was done extraperitoneally in the right iliac fossa. The donor's inferior vena cava was anastomosed to the recipient's distal caval vein side-to-side using 6-0 polydioxanone running suture as the piggyback technique, initially dealing with the short vena cava graft in the first case. At the end of the operation, the kidneys were positioned allowing the lateral aspect of each renal unit to face anteriorly as "closing the book." The cold ischemia time was 895 and 820 minutes, respectively. No vascular complication was observed postoperatively. The patients were discharged on POD 16 and POD 21 with an eGFR of 94 and 102 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. The graft function is stable during the 5- and 7-month follow-up.
