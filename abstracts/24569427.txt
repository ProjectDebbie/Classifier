Simplifying the management of caudal septal deviation in rhinoplasty.
Correction of the deviated nose poses a challenge in even the most experienced hands. Frequently, the surgeon is faced with both a functional (airway obstruction) and an aesthetic problem that must be addressed conjointly. Accurate preoperative analysis and intraoperative diagnosis are integral to good outcomes. Caudal septal deviation is frequently present in patients presenting for rhinoplasty. The authors' current graduated technique for simplifying the management of the caudally deviated septum both aesthetically and functionally is described. If there is a persistent caudal septal deviation that has not been addressed by standard maneuvers, the caudal portion of the anterior septum is resected at the osseocartilaginous junction with the anterior nasal spine and maxillary crest and then sutured back to the periosteum of the anterior nasal spine with 5-0 polydioxanone. We have found this to be a safe and effective way of addressing the caudally deviated septum in the majority of cases.
