Two fixation methods for acromioclavicular joint reduction during coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction: a biomechanical analysis.
One specimen from each of six pairs of cadaveric shoulders underwent a semitendinosus coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with a hook plate used for acromioclavicular joint reduction, while on the other specimen a polydioxanone (PDS) suture braid was utilized. Cyclical loading followed by maximal load-to-failure testing was performed. Displacement during cyclical loading, loads to 50% and 100% displacement, stiffness, and maximal load to failure were determined for all specimens.  showed that the locking hook plate allowed significantly less displacement of the coracoclavicular interval during cyclical loading (3.41 vs. 9.67 mm, p = .0081) and withstood significantly higher loads before both 50% (225.5 vs. 107.7 N, p = .0197) and 100% displacement (410.6 vs. 240.1 N, p = .0077). The locking hook plate was found to be significantly stiffer than the PDS suture braid (28.2 vs. 18.4 N/mm, p = .0029), but there was no difference in maximal load to failure between the two fixation methods (hook plate, 434.4 N; PDS, 476.7 N; p = .76).
