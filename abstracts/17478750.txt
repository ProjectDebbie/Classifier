Bioabsorbable interbody spacers.
Bioabsorbable polymers have been used in surgery for more than four decades. With increased reliability and decreased incidence of complications, their application has become widespread. Although their role in spinal surgery continues to evolve, the theoretic biomechanical and biologic advantages over contemporary metallic and composite implant materials make bioabsorbable interbody spacers an attractive alternative. The lack of artifact on postoperative imaging studies and the ability to load share across fusion sites in a time-dependent manner can lead to more accurate fusion assessment and increased fusion rates. The preliminary data from small, short-term studies are promising. However, larger studies with long-term follow-up are lacking. The theoretic advantages of bioabsorbable materials must be tempered by the lack of long-term clinical evidence of their benefit. Until the results of more studies in human spinal applications become available, the precise indications for the use of bioabsorbable interbody spacers will continue to evolve.
