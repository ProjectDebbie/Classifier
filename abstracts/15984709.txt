Incisional hernia following hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery for renal cell cancer.
For renal cell cancer, the hand-assisted laparoscopic approach provides several advantages while maintaining equal advantages with regards to patient recovery. We offer our experience with laparoscopic hand-assisted radical nephrectomy and the incidence of ventral wall hernia. Between February 1999 and July 2002, we performed 50 laparoscopic hand-assisted radical nephrectomies. A midline or a muscle splitting right lower quadrant incision was used depending on the side of the tumor. Hand-port incisions were all between 7 cm and 8 cm and closed with #1 polydioxanone sulfate suture in a running fashion. Three (6%) patients developed hand-port incisional hernias. All hernias occurred in midline hand-port sites. The average body weight of those who developed an incisional hernia was 137 kg. Although the cause of incisional hernia is multifactorial, we believe that obesity plays a significant role. The technical limitations involved in closing a short, deep ventral incision combined with the earlier return to activity of laparoscopy patients put this patient population at significant risk. We now perform an interrupted closure with nonabsorbable suture for the hand-assist incision and limited activity for 4 weeks to 6 weeks post procedure in high-risk patients. We have had no further wound hernias since adopting these changes.
