Polyester sutures for pancreaticojejunostomy protect against postoperative pancreatic fistula: a case-control, risk-adjusted analysis.
There is wide variability in the use of suture material for pancreatic anastomosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This study evaluates the role of suture material on clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) in a risk-adjusted setting. A retrospective study comparing (polyester) PE with polydioxanone (PDO) in 520 PDs. Patients were matched for risk for CR-POPF according to the fistula risk score (FRS) with the propensity score. The matched PE and PDO groups consisted of 232 patients. The incidence of CR-POPF was lower for PE group (11.6 vs. 22%, p<0.01), with a lower rate of grade B (10.3 vs. 15.5%, p<0.01) and C (1.3 vs. 6.5%, p<0.01). After stratifying by fistula risk zone, PE suture remained associated with a reduced incidence of CR-POPF (9.4 vs. 15.6% low-, p = 0.04; 15.6 vs. 28.1% intermediate-, p = 0.02; 16.7 vs. 83.3% high-risk zone, p<0.01, respectively). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that pancreatic texture, preoperative diagnosis, FRS and the use of PE sutures were independent predictors of CR-POPF. In the setting of a case-control matched for risk analysis, the use of PE suture for PJ is associated with a significant reduction of CR-POPF.
