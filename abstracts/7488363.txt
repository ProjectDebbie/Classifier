Extraluminal laryngotracheal fixation with absorbable miniplates.
To determine if miniplates made of polydioxanone can be used successfully for extraluminal laryngotracheal fixation. Twelve rabbits underwent anterior and posterior laryngotracheofissure with extraluminal fixation of the divided segments with polydioxanone miniplates. Three control animals did not undergo plating. Animals were killed after 2, 4, and 12 weeks. Larynges were removed and examined to determine the intraluminal area and histologic status of the repair site. The intraluminal area of the animals in the experimental group was 1.6 times that of those in the control group. The trachea was relined with respiratory mucosa by 2 weeks. Little inflammatory reaction was evident. Plate resorption was almost complete at 12 weeks. Polydioxanone plating is a feasible and well-tolerated method of extraluminal laryngotracheal fixation. It may be useful in the treatment of grade 2 or 3 subglottic stenosis.
