Biomaterial pretreatment with ECGF to augment endothelial cell proliferation.
ECGF, a polypeptide of bovine hypothalamic derivation, is the most potent endothelial cell mitogen known, with mitogenic and chemotactic effects well demonstrated in vitro on human endothelial cells. These effects are synergized by heparin. In vivo re-endothelialization of blood-contacting biomaterials may be enhanced by bonding ECGF and heparin to prosthetic surfaces. Long woven Dacron (24 mm) and woven PDS vascular prostheses were treated first with human plasma fibronectin (10 micrograms/cm2). Porcine sodium heparin (20 micrograms/cm2) was added by means of fibronectin's heparin affinity. Pure 125I-ECGF (95% alpha, 5% beta; 1 ng/cm2) was next fixed by the heparin affinity of ECGF and followed by a second heparin layer (20 micrograms/cm2) to synergize with and stabilize ECGF. 125I-ECGF adherences were determined by scintillation counts. Attachment efficiency averaged 25%. Prostheses were interposed into rabbit aortas and harvested in triplicate from 0 to 30 days to establish in vivo washout curves. After explantation, residual 125I-ECGF was eluted from prostheses, and intact ECGF was identified by SDS gel electrophoresis. Similarly prepared but nonradioiodinated Dacron and PDS prostheses were explanted after 7 days and their ECGF eluted off for in vitro activity documentation. This ECGF retained its mitogenic properties, causing a 1000% to 1200% increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in test murine LE-II cells. Fibronectin-heparin-ECGF fixation to blood-contacting biomaterials may enhance spontaneous re-endothelialization and/or hasten the confluence of transplanted endothelial cells.
