Polymer-Based Reconstruction of the Inferior Vena Cava in Rat: Stem Cells or RGD Peptide?
As part of a program targeted at developing a resorbable valved tube for replacement of the right ventricular outflow tract, we compared three biopolymers (polyurethane [PU], polyhydroxyalkanoate (the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate-co-4-hydroxyvalerate) [PHBVV]), and polydioxanone [PDO]) and two biofunctionalization techniques (using adipose-derived stem cells [ADSCs] or the arginine-glycine-aspartate [RGD] peptide) in a rat model of partial inferior vena cava (IVC) replacement. Fifty-three Wistar rats first underwent partial replacement of the IVC with an acellular electrospun PDO, PU, or PHBVV patch, and 31 nude rats subsequently underwent the same procedure using a PDO patch biofunctionalized either by ADSC or RGD.  were assessed both in vitro (proliferation and survival of ADSC seeded onto the different materials) and in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, immunohistochemistry [against markers of vascular cells (von Willebrand factor [vWF], smooth muscle actin [SMA]), and macrophages ([ED1 and ED2] immunostaining)], and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; for the expression of various cytokines and inducible NO synthase). PDO showed the best in vitro properties. Six weeks after implantation, MRI did not detect significant luminal changes in any group. All biopolymers were evenly lined by vWF-positive cells, but only PDO and PHBVV showed a continuous layer of SMA-positive cells at 3 months. PU patches resulted in a marked granulomatous inflammatory reaction. The ADSC and RGD biofunctionalization yielded similar outcomes. These data confirm the good biocompatibility of PDO and support the concept that appropriately peptide-functionalized polymers may be successfully substituted for cell-loaded materials.
