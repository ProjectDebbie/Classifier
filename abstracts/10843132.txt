Biomechanics of the coracoclavicular ligament complex and augmentations used in its repair and reconstruction.
Augmentation is a well-accepted and common component of coracoclavicular ligament repairs and reconstructions. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the strength, stiffness, and mode of failure of the coracoclavicular ligament complex and four different augmentation techniques in cadaveric shoulders. There was no significant difference in the mean failure load between the intact ligament complex (724.9+/-230.9 N) and augmentations performed with braided polydioxanone (PDS) (676.7+/-115.4 N) or braided polyethylene placed through (986.1+/-391.1 N) or around (762.7+/-218.2 N) the clavicle. The mean failure load for augmentations using a 6.5-mm cancellous screw through the clavicle and into a single cortex of the coracoid (390.1+/-253.6 N) was significantly lower than that for the intact coracoclavicular ligaments. There was no difference in mean stiffness between the intact coracoclavicular ligament complex (115.9+/-36.2 N/mm) and the braided polyethylene augmentations placed through (99.8+/-22.2 N/mm) or around (90.0+/-25.5 N/mm) the clavicle. Polydioxanone augmentations were significantly less stiff (27.4+/-3.3 N/mm) than the intact complex, while screw augmentations were significantly stiffer (250.4+/-88.2 N/mm). There were no significant differences in strength or stiffness of braided polyethylene reconstructions placed around or through a drill hole in the clavicle.
