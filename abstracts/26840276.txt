Beneficial Effect of a Resorbable Biliary Stent in Living Donor Liver Transplantation.
Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) entails a significant number of bile duct complications. We aimed to diminish the biliary complication rate with the use of a resorbable biliary stent (RBS) during LDLT. The objective of this study is to describe the surgical techniques and the associated outcomes, especially in terms of safety, of RBS use in LDLT. From 2011 to 2014, 12 LDLT recipients were enrolled in a clinical trial with the use of a specifically designed RBS. These patients were followed according to the clinical protocol. Specific complications derived from RBS as well as biliary complications were recorded. One patient underwent early retransplantation due to a small-for-size syndrome. None of the patients had a complication attributable to the placement, remaining in place, or degradation of the stent. Four of the remaining patients presented with a biliary complication: 1 (9.1%) with a biliary leak alone, 1 (9.1%) with a biliary stenosis alone, and 2 (18.2%) with both. However, none of the leaks could be directly attributed to the RBS. Patient and graft 1-year survival was 100 and 91.7%, respectively. The use of an RBS in LDLT is not associated with complications, and initial results regarding efficacy and safety are encouraging. The need for a larger and prospective study is warranted.
