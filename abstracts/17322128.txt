Biomechanical evaluation of minimally invasive repairs for complete acromioclavicular joint dislocation.
The conventional coracoclavicular ligament augmentation with a single polydioxanone loop has been shown to have some pivotal disadvantages. A minimally invasive flip button/polydioxanone repair provides similar biomechanical properties to the conventional polydioxanone cerclage around the coracoid. However, the authors expected a difference in linear stiffness, ultimate load, and permanent elongation between suture anchor repairs and polydioxanone repairs. Controlled laboratory study. The tensile fixation strength of 4 different minimally invasive repairs was tested in a porcine metatarsal model: (1) 1.3-mm single polydioxanone cerclage with a subcoracoidal flip button fixation, (2) 1.3-mm single polydioxanone cerclage, (3) Twinfix Ti 3.5-mm/Ultrabraid 2-suture anchor, and (4) Twinfix Ti 5.0-mm/Ultrabraid 2-suture anchor. The testing protocol included cyclic superoinferior loading and a subsequent load to failure trial. The flip button repair (646 N) and the conventional polydioxanone banding (663 N) revealed significant higher ultimate loads than did the suture anchor repairs (295 and 331 N, respectively; P < .001), whereas no significant differences were found for the elongation behavior under cyclic loading. There was no significant difference between the 2 polydioxanone repairs. The ultimate load of the flip button procedure reaches the level of the native coracoclavicular ligament complex as it has been quantified in the literature. Although the biomechanical results comparing a minimally invasive flip button procedure versus a conventional polydioxanone cerclage are similar, the authors recommend the flip button procedure because of its minimally invasive approach and the secure subcoracoidal fixation technique with a minimized risk of anterior loop dislocation and neurovascular damage.
