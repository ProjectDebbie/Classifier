Evaluation of the gross and histologic reactions to five commonly used suture materials in the skin of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).
Surgical harvest of Xenopus laevis oocytes for developmental research is a common procedure that requires closure of a 0.5- to 2.0-cm incision with suture material. Although such harvests are a frequent practice, little published information exists to provide guidance regarding the most appropriate suture material for wound closure in laboratory amphibians. To determine which suture material elicits the least response in amphibian skin, we used Xenopus laevis as a model to investigate the gross and histologic tissue reactions to 5 commonly used suture materials-3-0 silk, monofilament nylon, polydioxanone, polyglactin 910, and chromic gut. The skin reacted in 3 ways to suture material, showing edema, epidermal changes, and inflammation. Although the gross reactions to monofilament nylon, polydioxanone, and polyglactin 910 were clinically indistinguishable and were associated with lowest gross reaction scores, monofilament nylon elicited the least histologic reaction and therefore seems to be the most appropriate choice for use in amphibian skin.
