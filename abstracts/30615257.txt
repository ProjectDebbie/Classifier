Polymer scaffold architecture is a key determinant in mast cell inflammatory and angiogenic responses.
Implanted polymer scaffolds can induce inflammation leading to the foreign body response (FBR), fibrosis, and implant failure. Thus, it is important to understand how immune cells interact with scaffolds to mitigate inflammation and promote a regenerative response. We previously demonstrated that macrophage phenotype is modulated by fiber and pore diameters of an electrospun scaffold. However, it is unclear if this effect is consistent among other innate immune cells. Mast cells are inflammatory sentinels that play a vital role in the FBR of implanted biomaterials, as well as angiogenesis. We determined if altering electrospun scaffold architecture modulates mast cell responses, with the goal of promoting regenerative cell-scaffold interactions. Polydioxanone (PDO) scaffolds were made from 60 mg/mL or 140 mg/mL PDO solutions, yielding structures with divergent fiber and pore diameters. Mouse mast cells plated on these scaffolds were activated with IL-33 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Relative to the 60 mg/mL scaffold, 140 mg/mL scaffolds yielded less IL-6 and TNF, and greater VEGF secretion. Pores >4-6 μm elicited less IL-6 and TNF secretion. IL-33-induced VEGF regulation was more complex, showing effects of both pore size and fiber diameter. These data indicate parameters that can predict mast cell responses to scaffolds, informing biomaterial design to increase wound healing and diminish implant rejection. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
