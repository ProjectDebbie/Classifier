Suture material in bladder surgery: a comparison of polydioxanone, polyglactin, and chromic catgut.
A comparison of polydioxanone, polyglactin, and chromic catgut suture was performed in 120 rat bladders studying propensity for infection, degree of inflammation, calculogenic potential, changes in urine pH, and suture absorption. None of the sutures predisposed to infection and there was wide variability but no correlation in urine pH. Although initially the polydioxanone incited a greater inflammatory response, by six months all three sutures were similar. The absorption of polydioxanone was slower than chromic catgut suture, but similar to the absorption of polyglactin. There was no significant difference in calculogenic potential between the suture materials tested over a six-month period. Based on this study in rats, polydioxanone suture would appear to be equal to catgut and polyglactin suture in bladder surgery.
