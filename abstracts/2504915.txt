Clip appendectomy.
The clip appendectomy is an alternative to the classical suture appendectomy. The use of a new polymer clip facilitates this technique. During pelvic reconstructive surgery an appendectomy may be indicated when suspected appendiceal pathology (such as endometriosis) could adversely affect the surgical outcome. Clip appendectomy can reduce the operative time without increasing morbidity.
