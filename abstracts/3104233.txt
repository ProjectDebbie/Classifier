The use of absorbable suture: morphological findings in a newborn three months after coarctation repair.
The macroscopic and histological findings in a case of surgical repair of aortic coarctation in a newborn, performed using polydioxanone, a monofilament absorbable suture material, are reported. The persistence of suture material three months after surgery, the lack of severe inflammatory changes, calcification and elastic disruption of the arterial wall, confirm previous experimental data. For these characteristics, the use of polydioxanone in the repair of aortic coarctation in newborns is suggested, in order to avoid recoarctation, the most frequent complication of this surgical therapy.
