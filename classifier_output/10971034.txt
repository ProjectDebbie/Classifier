Bioartificial cartilage.
Cartilage is a highly differentiated tissue. Its three-dimensional composition of cells and matrix is able to resist intensive mechanical loads. The capacity of cartilage tissue for regeneration is limited. Chondrocytes are responsible for matrix production of cartilage tissue. Enzymatic isolation and expansion of chondrocytes with cell culture techniques has been improved in the last years. These cells can be cultured on different three-dimensional culture systems suitable for transplantation to repair localized cartilage defects. Two types of bioresorbable polymer fleece matrices (PLLA and a composite fleece of polydioxanone and polyglactin) and lyophilized dura as a biological carrier are tested. Phenotypic and morphological appearance of the cultured articular rabbit chondrocytes is preserved on all three types of transport media. Production of glycosaminoglycans has been shown by Alcian blue staining, production of collagen by azan staining. Chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate are detected immunohistochemically in the created constructs. The different carriers have specific characteristics regarding their suitability for the creation of bioartificial cartilage. This tissue is transplantable into articular cartilage defects and could, therefore, improve the minor intrinsic healing capacity of cartilage tissue.
