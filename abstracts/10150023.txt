Primary mass closure of fascial incisions using a continuous absorbable suture.
Investigations with animal models and reported studies from the obstetric and gynecologic literature as well as the general surgical literature have suggested that a single mass closure is equal or superior to interrupted suture techniques.  Over a 12-month period, 150 patients were operated on using a continuous mass technique for fascial closure with No.1 polydioxanone suture (PDS).  One hundred thirty-five patients (90%) had risk factors that placed them at increased likelihood for wound complications.  No fascial disruptions occurred.  Wound complications were noted in 15 patients (10%).  This technique merits wider use.
