Polydioxanone in digestive surgery. An experimental study.
An experimental study was carried out to analyze the reaction of polydioxanone suture. Two hundred ten single layer colonic anastomoses were performed in rats and histopathologically studied at nine different times between the 2nd and 180th postoperative days. Eighteen of 105 abdominal wound closures were studied in the same way between the 7th and 90th days. Polydioxanone was resorbed slowly in approximately 6 months with minimum inflammation. We believe that polydioxanone is actually the suture material of choice for all biliary and biliodigestive sutures.
