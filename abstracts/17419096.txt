Left ventricular reconstruction by modified linear technique with absorbable suture.
Linear and endoventricular techniques of left ventricular (LV) reconstruction often utilise prosthetic material for epicardial reinforcement or endocardial patch. We report a technique of LV aneurysm repair using absorbable suture without prosthetic material. Between November 1999 and August 2004, 55 patients underwent linear LV reconstruction, for ischaemic cardiomyopathy, using only continuous 3/0 polydioxanone suture. Survival, functional class and echocardiographic outcomes are reported. Fifty-two patients (mean age 64+/-10 years) were studied. There was no perioperative mortality and the Kaplan-Meier survival at five years was 81%. Fifty-one patients underwent postoperative follow up (mean 28 months) with echocardiography (mean 20 months). There were no recurrent aneurysms. The postoperative LV eccentricity index (EI) was 0.72 (CI 0.48-0.9). Mean LV ejection fraction increased from 0.33+/-0.09 preoperatively to 0.41+/-0.15 at late follow up (mean within patient change 0.08+/-0.15, p=0.003). Mean symptom class improved from 3.3+/-0.8 to 1.6+/-0.7 (mean within patient improvement 1.6+/-1.0, p<0.001). Mitral regurgitation of grade 2/4 was identified in six patients and grade 3/4 in one patient. Linear repair with absorbable suture material and without prosthetic material may be safely undertaken with good early and mid-term results.
