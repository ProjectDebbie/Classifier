The relationship between five kinds of laparoscopic knots and five types of suture materials and histological findings in tissues: an experimental study on rabbits.
The aim of the current study was to examine the slipping and the tightening of laparoscopic knots with various kinds of sutures, as well as the histologic alterations in tissues. Fifty rabbits and five kinds of sutures were used-silk, polyglactine-910 (Vicryl), Polydioxanone (PDS), Polyglycol (Dexon), and cat-gut chromic-and five laparoscopic knots were used-Tayside, Roeder, Melzer, Cross, and Blood. The knots were performed extracorporeally and were used to ligate a part of the omentum. Sliding and tightening of the knots were evaluated. The omentum, the suture, and the knots were checked 10 days and 1 month after operation. Histologic examination was performed 1 month after surgery. Polyglactine-910 (Vicryl) and silk were the most qualitative sutures used in Tayside, Roeder, and Blood knots and the least harmful for the tissues. Catgut chromic and Polydioxanone (PDS) were the most defective sutures. The most efficient laparoscopic slipknots are Tayside, Roeder, and Blood, especially when constructed with silk and polyglactine-910 (Vicryl).
