Repair of flexor tendon defects of rabbit with tissue engineering method.
To repair rabbit tendon defects with tissue engineering method. The third passage of fetal skin fibroblast cells was labeled with 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine (Brdu) and then seeded on human amnion extracellular matrix (HA-ECM). Using 1 cm-long-Achilles tendon defects as repairing models in the experimental group, tendon defects were core bridged with polydioxanone (PDS) and then capsulated with the complex of fibroblasts-HA-ECM. In the control group I, defective tendons were sutured with PDS following the former procedure and capsulated with HA-ECM (without fibroblasts). In the control group II, only PDS was applied to connect the defective tendons. Gross examination, light microscopy, scanning electronmicroscopy and biomechanical measurement of the repaired tendons were respectively performed at postoperative 1, 2, 3 month as well as immunohistochemical examination. The optimal cell concentration for seeding fibroblasts was 3.5 x 10(6) cells/ml. Cells grew well and radiated or paralleled on HA-ECM. Immunohistochemistry showed that the labeled seed fibroblasts played an important role in tendonization. The results of light microscopy, electron microscopy, and biomechanical assessment suggested that the rate and quality of tendonization in the experimental group was superior to those of the control group I and II. The tensile strength in the experimental group was the greatest, the next was in the control group I, and the worst in the control group II (P<0.05). HA-ECM is the excellent carrier for fibroblasts. Fibroblasts-HA-ECM complex has the capability to repair tendon defect and to tendonize with rapid rate and good performance three months after operation. Its tensile strength is 81.8% of that of normal tendon.
