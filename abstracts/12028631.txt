Effect of argon-beam coagulation on the integrity of suture material.
To evaluate the effect of argon-beam coagulator (ABC) energy on suture materials. Six absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials (polyglactin, chromic catgut, polydioxanone, silk, poliglecaprone, and Gore-Tex) were placed under tension and exposed to ABC energy to determine breaking times. Subsequently, all suture materials were exposed to limited ABC energy, and tensiometry was used to determine decreases in breaking strengths. Among the suture materials tested, Gore-Tex was the most resistant to ABC energy. Although absorbable suture materials were less resistant than nonabsorbable suture materials, 2-0 polyglactin manifested the greatest resiliance to deterioration with ABC energy exposure. The ABC has differential effects on suture materials. Larger-gauge suture materials are more resistant to ABC than smaller materials. Similarly, nonabsorbable sutures are generally more resilient to ABC energy than absorbable materials. Among the suture materials evaluated in our in vitro model, 2-0 Gore-Tex was best suited for vascular ligation, and 2-0 polyglactin is optimal for renal collecting system closure if ABC is anticipated as an adjunct for hemostasis.
