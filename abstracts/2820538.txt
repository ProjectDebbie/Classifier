Suture materials in contaminated wounds: a detailed comparison of a new suture with those currently in use.
The relationship between five different suture materials (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polypropylene, polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and polyglactin 910) and infection has been studied in 540 guinea-pig wounds contaminated with synergistic enteric organisms. The recently introduced expanded PTFE suture has been studied because, unlike the others, it has not previously been studied under these contaminated conditions. The incidence of wound infection in the control series was 26 per cent and all suture materials increased this figure significantly. The infection rate using expanded PTFE of 51 per cent was similar to all other sutures except polyglycolic acid, which produced an infection rate of 41 per cent. This difference was not statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. This confirms other studies including our own which show that the presence of most suture materials in contaminated wounds increases the incidence of infection. It further demonstrates that expanded PTFE is no different from other materials in this regard.
