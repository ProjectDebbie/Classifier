Mechanical knot performance of a new generation polydioxanon suture (PDS-2).
To improve the handling characteristics of synthetic resorbable monofilament PDS (polydioxanon), a second-generation (PDS-2) suture has been developed. The mechanical knot performance of this suture was tested in square knots and sliding knots and compared with other monofilament suture materials. Knot performance was defined by the loop holding capacity (LHC) and expressed in Newton's (N). Maxon (polyglycolid-three-methylene carbonate) had significantly better knot performance than the other sutures. Knot performance of Prolene (polypropylene) was significantly poorer than that of the other sutures. Ordinary PDS (polydioxanon) and PDS-2 (polydioxanon) showed intermediate results. Knot performance of PDS-2 was similar to (square knots) or poorer than (sliding knots) that of ordinary PDS. It was concluded that knot performance of ordinary PDS is not improved by the introduction of PDS-2. It is emphasized that surgeons should be aware of the mechanical properties of newly developed suture materials. Underlying factors and clinical implications of the mechanical performance of PDS-2 are discussed.
