Comparison of Maxon suture with Vicryl, chromic catgut, and PDS sutures in fascial closure in rats.
Two hundred ten rats were randomized into one of five study groups to compare standard absorbable sutures with a new synthetic absorbable suture. We evaluated Maxon (polyglyconate), Vicryl (polyglactin), chromic catgut (catgut), and PDS (polydioxanone) with respect to tissue inflammatory reaction, knot security, suture tensile strength, and suture absorption. The results indicate that Maxon and PDS elicited a lower degree of chronic inflammation when compared with Vicryl and chromic catgut. The tensile strengths of Maxon and Vicryl significantly exceeded those of PDS and chromic catgut during the critical period of wound healing. Maxon and PDS retained a larger percentage of tensile strength during the long postoperative period, whereas Vicryl and chromic catgut were mostly absorbed. Maxon is an excellent addition to the armamentarium of the gynecologic surgeon.
