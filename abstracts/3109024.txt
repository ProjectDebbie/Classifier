Subclavian flap angioplasty with absorbable suture polydioxanone (PDS). An experimental study in growing piglets.
The fate of the subclavian flap in aortoplasty was studied and a new synthetic monofilament, absorbable vascular suture (polydioxanone, PDS) was evaluated. In 11 piglets submitted to the aortic repair, the diameter of the aortic arch and descending aorta and the length and width of the subclavian flap were measured. The aortoplasty was performed with a continuous running suture of 6/0 PDS. All the animals survived and grew normally. They were sacrificed 6-26 weeks postoperatively, when the mentioned variables were reestimated. No aortic narrowing was found and no suture material was detectable in the lumen. The subclavian flap had grown uniformly in length and width. Histologic examination showed evening of the inner surface by intimal proliferation and healing of the anastomoses. There was no sign of flap destruction and tissue reaction to PDS suture was minimal, indicating normal growth and viability in all parts of the flap. The suture material was absorbed 26 weeks postoperatively. Continuous suture with absorbable PDS seems to be a good alternative for repair of aortic coarctation in early infancy.
