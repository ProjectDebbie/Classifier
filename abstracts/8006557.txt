One layer continuous anastomosis of the alimentary tract with absorbable polydioxanone suture.
A prospective study using absorbable Polydioxanone (PDS) suture material in a one layer continuous technique for gastrointestinal anastomosis was conducted. There were 40 anastomoses constructed in 39 children and 61 anastomoses in 49 adults which were classified as "non-complicated anastomoses" without any clinical evidence of leakage or any other complications attributable to the anastomotic technique or to the suture materials. There were other 20 anastomoses created in 20 patients with malnutrition or those receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation or where there was tension at the anastomosis which were classified as "complicated anastomosis". Anastomotic leakage was observed in one patient (5%). The starvation period was 3.16 +/- 0.9 days compared to 3.46 +/- 1.0 days in the two layer technique "control" group. The rate of complications and the function of the GI tract in both non-complicated and complicated anastomoses after one layer continuous Polydioxanone anastomotic completion was not significantly different from those using conventional two layer anastomosis. The technique for one layer continuous suture is simple, easy and takes less time than the conventional method. This technique also theoretically provides better postoperative condition in which bowel anatomy and physiology can return to normal earlier, causing minimal tissue trauma, and less narrowing of the lumen although the evidence cannot be supported by this study. The Polydioxanone suture material is biodegraded by specific time, and hence allows normal growth of the anastomosed bowel; it is therefore suitable for both children and adults.
