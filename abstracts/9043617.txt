Osteochondritis dissecans of the patella: arthroscopic fixation with bioabsorbable pins.
Osteochondritis dissecans of the patella is a relatively rare condition. Surgical treatment has been recommended for those patients who fail conservative treatment, or who present with mechanical symptoms or loose bodies. In an attempt to preserve the patellofemoral articulation, we describe a new technique to arthroscopically fix osteochondritic lesions of the patella using bioabsorbable pins. This technique avoids the morbidity of a formal arthrotomy as well as the complications associated with metallic hardware.
