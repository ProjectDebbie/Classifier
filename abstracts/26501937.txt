Polydioxanone Absorbable Plate for Cartilaginous Grafting in Endonasal Rhinoplasty: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
Robotic systems have been used to enhance the surgeon's dexterity and visualization in endoscopic surgery and thus facilitate refined dissection, suturing, and knot tying. We describe use of the da Vinci surgical system for robotic-assisted thoracoscopic bronchoplasty in patient with centrally located lung cancer. We used three robotic ports (a 12-mm trocar for the 30Â°-down camera and two 8-mm trocars for the robotic instrument arms) and one utility incision for assistance and specimen retrieval. Lung isolation were achieved using double-lumen endotracheal tube without carbon dioxide inflation. The bronchoplasty was performed by using 4/0 polydioxanone suture (PDS). Three cases of robotic-assisted thoracoscopic bronchoplasty (n=3) were performed. Case 1: right upper lobe lobectomy with right main bronchus primary closure; case 2: right upper lobe lobectomy with the anterior wall of the right main bronchus re-anastomosis; case 3: left upper lobe sleeve lobectomy. The surgery and post-operative course were smooth without complication. We suggest that robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery offers specific advantages over conventional thoracoscopic surgery with accuracy and safety when doing bronchoplasty.
