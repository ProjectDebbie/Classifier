9-O monofilament polydioxanone (PDS): a new synthetic absorbable suture for cataract wound closure.
This study describes the intraoperative and postoperative performance of 9-O monofilament Polydioxanone (PDS) suture for cataract wound closure. This newly developed synthetic absorbable suture is designed to meet the need for a "long-term" absorbable suture material suitable for cataract wound closure following intraocular lens implantation. Polydioxanone's advantages over currently used "short-term" absorbables and biodegradable nylon are described in this report.
