Meniscal repair for anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus.
This technical note describes all-inside meniscal repair for anterior horn tears of the lateral meniscus. A modified anteromedial portal is created for use in visualizing the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. A crescent-shaped suture hook loaded with a polydioxanone suture (PDS) is inserted through an anterolateral portal. The hook tip penetrates the meniscal peripheral rim and advances across the tear. The suture hook penetrates the mobile central fragment. A leading limb of the PDS is advanced into the knee joint. Then, the leading limb of the suture is retrieved back to the anterolateral portal. With 2 limbs of PDS, endoscopic knot tying is done. With this simple technique, vertically oriented all-inside meniscal repair of an anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus with the use of absorbable suture materials is easily performed.
