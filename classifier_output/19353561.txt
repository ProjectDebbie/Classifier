Evaluation of thrombogenic potential of electrospun bioresorbable vascular graft materials: acute monocyte tissue factor expression.
The purpose of this study was to quantify the acute expression of tissue factor (TF) by monocytes on interaction with electrospun bioresorbable constructs. A minimal expression of TF will demonstrate the potential for scaffolds to be used as a vascular graft without enhanced risk of failure from acute thrombotic occlusion. Polydioxanone (PDO) (60, 80, 120, and 160 mg/mL) and polycaprolactone (PCL) (80, 10, and 160 mg/mL) dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP) were electrospun to form fibrous scaffolds. Circular discs (10 mm diameter) of each scaffold were disinfected and seeded with human monocytes (50,000 cells/well). The discs were statically cultured under standard conditions (37 degrees C and 5% CO2), and removed after 24 h for TF analysis with an In-Cell Western assay. Fiber diameter was calculated through ImageTool analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Acute monocyte interaction with scaffolds of PCL (120 mg/mL) resulted in the lowest amount of TF expressed (4 ng/disc), whereas scaffolds of 160 mg/mL PDO elicited the highest amount of TF expressed (51 ng/disc). TF levels expressed on all scaffolds were comparable with the amount expressed on e-PTFE (20 ng/disc). Preliminary data for TF expression on scaffolds of silk (70 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL) and silk:PCL (100 mg/mL, v/v) blends (50:50 and 70:30) resulted in values of TF expression ranging from 0 to 24 ng.  from this study reveal electrospun grafts composed of PDO and PCL provide no greater risk of failure from an acute thrombotic occlusion due to TF expression when compared with that of the standard e-PTFE graft.
