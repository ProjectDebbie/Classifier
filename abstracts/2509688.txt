Subcuticular skin closure following minor breast biopsy: Prolene is superior to polydioxanone (PDS)
The aim of this study was to determine whether a subcuticular absorbable suture (polydioxanone acid, PDS, Ethicon, UK) was superior to a subcuticular non-absorbable suture (Prolene, Ethicon, UK) for day-case breast biopsy performed under local anaesthesia. After breast biopsy, the type of subcuticular suture to be used was randomized in 100 patients. In all other respects the surgery and written postoperative instructions were similar for the group. Patients were reviewed over two visits by one independent observer who was unaware of the suture utilized (median 10 days and 52 days after surgery). Three patients had incomplete documentation and four patients failed to attend for either visit: thus 47 and 46 patients in the Prolene and PDS groups, respectively, were assessed. There was no difference between the Prolene and PDS groups, respectively, in the median interval to either the first shower or removal of the original plaster. There were three wound infections (one with Prolene, two with PDS). At the first visit three patients in the Prolene group had their incision uncovered, compared to 20 patients in the PDS group. In the PDS group a buried knot eroded through the incision in eight patients (17%). In this study the expected advantages of an absorbable suture were not confirmed.
