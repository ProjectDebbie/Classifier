Characterization of compression behaviors of fully covered biodegradable polydioxanone biliary stent for human body: A numerical approach by finite element model.
This paper presents a study of the compression behaviors of fully covered biodegradable polydioxanone biliary stents (FCBPBs) developed for human body by finite element method. To investigate the relationship between the compression force and structure parameter (monofilament diameter and braid-pin number), nine numerical models based on actual biliary stent were established, the simulation and experimental results are in good agreement with each other when calculating the compression force derived from both experiment and simulation results, indicating that the simulation results can be provided a useful reference to the investigation of biliary stents. The stress distribution on FCBPBSs was studied to optimize the structure of FCBPBSs. In addition, the plastic dissipation analysis and plastic strain of FCBPBSs were obtained via the compression simulation, revealing the structure parameter effect on the tolerance.
