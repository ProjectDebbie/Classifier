Sternal fixation with resorbable suture material.
The applicability of absorbable sutures for sternal closure was investigated. Heavy braided Polydioxanon (PDS Ethicon) sutures were tested in a routine fashion, as were steel wire and braided polyester. In a pilot study, 2 patients (20%) had a complete sternal dehiscence. These results forced us to abandon the project.
