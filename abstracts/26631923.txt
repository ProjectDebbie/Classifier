The effects of four different suture materials on penile tissue of rats.
Several types of suture materials are being used for the correction of penile curvature and this study was designed to compare histopathological changes on penile tissue among different suture materials. A total of 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups and right cavernosal body was sutured with 5/0 sutures (ETB: polyethylene terephthalate; PRL: polypropylene; VCR: polyglactine; and PDS: polydioxanone). An identical needle (3/8-13 mm cutting) was passed through the cavernosal bodies in the sham group (SHAM). After 3 weeks, all rats were killed and penile tissues were examined to assess the level (0-3) of inflammation, granuloma formation and fibrosis. There was a statistically significant difference among five groups regarding inflammation, granuloma formation and fibrosis levels (P<0.01 for all). The histological changes in the PRL group were not different from the SHAM group. Although the levels of granulation and fibrosis in the PDS group were also similar to the SHAM group, inflammation level was significantly higher. The inflammation, granulation and fibrosis levels were the highest in the ETB group. VCR caused similar levels of granulation and fibrosis to ETB. In conclusion, PRL suture is associated with the least histopathological change in the penile tissue. PDS can theoretically be a reasonable alternative to PRL as it causes similar levels of granulation and fibrosis.
