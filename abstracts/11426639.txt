A Schwann cell-seeded intrinsic framework and its satisfactory biocompatibility for a bioartificial nerve graft.
To optimize the internal environment of a collagen nerve tube, we designed a Schwann cell-seeded intrinsic framework and its biocompatibility was investigated. We fixed 6-0 polyglactin woven filaments (Vicryl) or polydioxanone monofilaments (PDS) on a silicone ring in a net fashion. It was coated with matrigel and then incubated with cultured newborn or adult Schwann cells. Furthermore, we implanted 1.5-cm-long filament-filled collagen tubes in a rat model. Using a live/dead fluorescent assay and electron microscopy, we found that adherent Schwann cells onto filaments remained viable and oriented longitudinally along filaments. The preliminary in vivo study indicated that a mild inflammatory reaction was present around the tube wall. However, nerve regeneration occurred around and between filaments. We concluded that the arrangement of Schwann cell columns onto filaments was achieved, mimicking BÃ¼nger bands. It was shown that the biomaterials did not impede nerve regeneration.
