Antimicrobial effects of drug-containing electrospun matrices on osteomyelitis-associated pathogens.
To synthesize polydioxanone (PDS)-based drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as "matrices") containing vancomycin (VANC) and/or rifampicin (RIF) and investigate their effect on the inhibition of biofilm growth containing osteomyelitis (OM)-associated pathogens. PDS matrices were prepared by electrostatic spinning, and the drugs were incorporated as follows: group (G)1, 5wt%VANC; G2, 10wt%VANC; G3, 5wt%RIF; G4, 10wt%RIF; G5, 5wt%VANC+RIF; and G6, 10wt%VANC+RIF. A control group of pure PDS was also electrospun (G7). Biofilms formed by Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were grown on the electrospun matrices for 24 hours. The counts of viable cells were assessed after biofilm formation. The fiber morphology and biofilms were imaged using a scanning electron microscope. G5 and G6 and pure PDS (G7) had the lowest and highest mean number of viable cell counts, respectively (P < .05). Small and isolated clusters of bacteria with no mature biofilm present were found on G6. The results of the present study have provided evidence for the potential use of PDS-based matrices as an effective drug delivery system that could inhibit biofilm formation from OM-associated pathogens.
