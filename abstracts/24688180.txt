Ex vivo evaluation of 7 polydioxanone for closure of equine ventral midline celiotomies.
The objective of this study was to compare the bursting strength (BS) and mode of failure (MF) of ventral midline (VM) celiotomies closed with USP 7 polydioxanone (7PD) in 1 or 2 simple continuous sections. A bursting strength model, consisting of inserting and inflating a 200-L polyurethane bladder through a 25-cm VM celiotomy, was used on 15 fresh equine cadavers. Celiotomies were closed using 7PD in 2 separate sections (4 knots), 2 continuous sections (3 knots), or a single section (2 knots) using a simple continuous pattern. The horses' signalment, body weight, number of total knots, MF, and BS were recorded and analyzed statistically for interactions. No difference was found between the BS of VM celiotomies closure types (P = 0.4). All celiotomy/ suture constructs failed at the abdominal wall. The celiotomy closure types evaluated in this study provided a secure method of closure in VM celiotomies in vivo.
