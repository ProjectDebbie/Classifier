The use of a new suture material (Polydioxanone) in the biliary tract.
The use of a new synthetic absorbable suture material, polydioxanone, has been assessed over a period in excess of three years in 63 patients undergoing surgical procedures on the biliary tract. The material, which was used exclusively for all ligatures and sutures, has greater pliability and strength than other absorbable materials and was found to be highly satisfactory. No suture-related complications were identified and the handling properties of the material were excellent. This material can be recommended for use in the biliary tract where it is desirable to use a reliable absorbable suture which evokes minimal tissue reaction.
