Suture materials: do they affect fistula and stricture rates in flap urethroplasties?
The effect of suture materials on urethroplasty complications is debated. Indeed, materials with a delayed absorption might either reduce the incidence of fistulas by ensuring a prolonged approximation of neo-urethral edges or increase the risk of urethral strictures due to a prolonged tissue reaction during suture absorption. We retrospectively evaluated the role of suture materials in the complication rate of urethroplasty procedures performed in our institution over a 10-year period. Three hundred and thirty-six boys undergoing a flap procedure (parameatal based, preputial tube, or onlay preputial flap) for hypospadias repair were considered for this study. The patients were stratified into two groups according to the suture material used for urethroplasty. Polyglactin (Vicryl), a polyfilament with intermediate absorption, was used in 254 group A patients, whereas polydioxanone (PDS), a monofilament with prolonged absorption, was used in 82 group B patients. The success of a one-stage repair and stricture and fistula rates were evaluated. A successful one-stage repair was achieved in 82% of the group A and in 83% of the group B patients (p = 0.97). No statistically significant differences were noted in fistula and/or stricture rates in the two groups, even considering each procedure separately. This series suggests that suture materials do not affect the complication rate in flap urethroplasty procedures. Appropriate technique, meticulous surgery, and surgeon experience seem to be more crucial factors. A randomized trial is warranted.
