Technical description and outcomes of a continuous anastomosis in open radical prostatectomy.
To describe the surgical technique, objective and subjective medium-term outcomes of a novel continuous vesico-urethral anastomotic suture in open radical prostatectomy (ORP). A continuous anastomosis comprising separate anterior and posterior monofilament 3-0 polydioxanone sutures, with the bladder neck 'parachuted' down on to the urethral stump, was used in 39 consecutive patients. A cystogram was taken after ORP in the first 23 patients. The catheter was removed as soon as patients were fully mobile. A validated postal questionnaire to determine continence and its effect on quality of life was sent to all patients â‰¥3 months after ORP. The mean follow-up was 18 months; there were no major complications. There was an insignificant or no leak in 91% of the patients who had a cystogram. Before discharge, 33 patients reported that they were continent, whilst five required a pad(s) for stress incontinence, and one was discharged with a catheter after failing the first catheter removal. Of the 95% who completed the questionnaire, 95% either did not leak urine, or only leaked a small amount; 84% of patients reported that leaking had a minimal effect on everyday life. No patients developed symptomatic urethral or bladder neck stricture/contracture. Our technique of continuous anastomotic suturing for ORP is safe, reliable and well tolerated. Further randomized studies are warranted to compare the outcome with the standard interrupted vesico-urethral anastomosis.
