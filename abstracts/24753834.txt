Evaluation of sternal closure with absorbable polydioxanone sutures in children.
Sternal dehiscence, sternal wound infection and mediastinitis are troublesome complications following median sternotomy which are major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients. Synthetic polydioxanone absorbable suture seems effective in prevention of these complications in children undergoing open heart surgery. During 2 years period, 620 patients who underwent median sternotomy were studied. The efficacy of absorbable polydioxanone suture was tested on patients using figure-of-eight suture technique. The patients' age ranged from newborn to 15 years old. All surgical interventions were performed according to a standard protocol. No sternal sutures were broken during the sternal closure and no case of mediastinitis was seen. Two patients experienced sternal dehiscence (0.32%). Follow-up period of patients were established between 1 to 132 months after open heart surgery. Sternal closure with the polydioxanone suture in combination with figure-of-eight technique is a safe and suitable method in children with good clinical results.
