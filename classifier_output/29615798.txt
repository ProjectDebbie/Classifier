Aligned laminin core-polydioxanone/collagen shell fiber matrices effective for neuritogenesis.
Neural tissue regeneration is a significant challenge, because severe nerve injury is quite difficult to regenerate spontaneously. Although, many studies have been devoted to promote nerve regeneration, there are still many technical challenges to achieve satisfactory results. In this study, we designed biomimetic matrices composed of aligned laminin core-polydioxanone/collagen shell (Lam-PDO/Col) fibers, which can provide both topographical and biochemical cues for promoting neuritogenesis. The aligned Lam-PDO/Col core-shell fiber matrices were fabricated by magnetic field-assisted electrospinning with the coaxial system, and their potential as biofunctional scaffolds for promoting neuritogenesis was explored. It was demonstrated that the aligned Lam-PDO/Col core-shell fibers were successfully fabricated, and the laminin in the core of fibers was steadily and continuously released from fibers. In addition, the cellular behaviors of hippocampal neuronal cells on the matrices were significantly enhanced. Moreover, the aligned Lam-PDO/Col fiber matrices effectively improved and guided neurite outgrowth as well as the neurogenic differentiation by providing both topographical and biochemical cues through aligned fiber structure and sustained release of laminin. Collectively, it is suggested that the aligned Lam-PDO/Col core-shell fiber matrices are one of the most promising approaches for promoting neuritogenesis and neural tissue regeneration.
