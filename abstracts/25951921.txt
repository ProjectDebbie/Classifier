Early skin reaction of polydioxanone suture material following septorhinoplasty.
Septorhinoplasty is a frequent surgical procedure used for both cosmetic and functional purposes. The technique varies from surgeon to surgeon and according to which suture material is used. While some surgeons prefer non-absorbable sutures, others prefer sutures with delayed absorption. These materials sometimes protrude from the skin and they may cause skin reactions. While these reactions are common in the late period, a skin reaction in the early period because of polydioxanone suture is extremely rare and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such reported case in the literature. A 25-year-old male patient underwent endonasal septorhinoplasty procedure with endo-tracheal general anesthesia. We hereby present the skin reaction because of frequently used polydioxanone suture on the 24th postoperative day and the management of this patient. We cut the suture at skin level and prescribed antibiotherapy, and we scheduled a follow-up for 10 days afterwards. The patient had no complaint and the control examination result was normal. When performing septorhinoplasty operations, very rare complications of the procedure shouldn't be ignored and an informed consent must be obtained after explaining possible complications before the operation. This approach is important for increasing the patient compliance and proper follow-up for the patient. This way, especially post-operative early complications as our case will be able to be solved with close follow-up and intervention, before causing permanent damage. The relationship between patient who underwent rhinoplasty and the physician also has an important role on these follow-up visits.
