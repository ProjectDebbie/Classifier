Chest wall stabilization with synthetic reabsorbable material.
Experimental results and preliminary clinical experience with synthetic reabsorbable materials in chest wall reconstruction are reported. Six beagle dogs underwent chest wall resection involving three or four consecutive ribs. Reparative procedure was performed by construction of a polydioxanone-band grid, anchored to the adjacent undamaged ribs. A mild wound infection developed in 1 animal but resolved without rejection of the prosthesis. The experimental material has shown favorable properties, both mechanical and biological. Subsequently, 11 patients, with different indications, underwent reconstructive procedures of the chest wall with reabsorbable prostheses. No complications have occurred. Long-term stability was excellent in all patients, with a mean follow-up longer than 6 months. The advantages of reabsorbable compounds are pointed out along with the possible applications for chest wall reconstruction after chest wall resection.
