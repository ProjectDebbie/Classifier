Woven polydioxanone biodegradable stents: a new treatment option for benign and malignant oesophageal strictures.
We present our initial experience with a new biodegradable (BD) esophageal stent in two patients, one for a therapy-resistant benign esophageal stricture, and the other as a temporary measure during curative radiotherapy for oesophageal carcinoma. The BD stents need to be loaded into a conventional pull-back delivery system but are then placed in a standard fashion. Pre-dilatation should be avoided to reduce the risk of migration, however if migration occurs the stents can be left to dissolve in the stomach. The stents are radiolucent but easily identified on CT with minimal artefact and thus might even aid with radiotherapy planning. BD stents offer an exciting new strategy for therapy-resistant benign strictures as well as a supportive measure for oesophageal cancer undergoing non-surgical treatment.
