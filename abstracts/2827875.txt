In-vivo comparison of four absorbable sutures: Vicryl, Dexon Plus, Maxon and PDS.
Absorbable sutures are initially equal or superior to nonabsorbable sutures in terms of tensile strength but are absorbed at variable rates by the action of hydrolysis. This study demonstrated that the in-vivo half-life tensile strength of the braided absorbable sutures polyglycolic acid (Dexon Plus) and polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) is 2 weeks, whereas those of the monofilament absorbable sutures polyglyconate (Maxon) and polydioxanone (PDS) are 3 and 6 weeks respectively. The addition of a single hitch or six knots reduced the in-vitro tensile strength by 30% to 35%. Polyglyconate (Maxon) suture demonstrated the best in-vitro knot security.
