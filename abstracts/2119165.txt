 of aortic anastomoses made under tension using polydioxanone suture.
After early repair of congenital cardiovascular defects, such as coarctation of the aorta, late stenosis may become a problem. Use of absorbable sutures has been shown to be superior to use of nonabsorbable sutures in allowing growth of an anastomotic site along with the individual. Some concern has been raised, however, about the potential for aneurysm formation at the site of anastomosis when absorbable sutures are used. This study was undertaken to observe the effects of longitudinal tension on anastomoses made with absorbable polydioxanone suture in growing animals. Six piglets (aged 3 to 4 weeks) underwent a 1-cm resection of the infrarenal aorta and reanastomosis with polydioxanone suture. One animal died prematurely of respiratory illness. The 5 remaining animals were killed after 6 months. The excised aortas demonstrated no stenosis, no dilatation, and no burst-test failure to 250 mm Hg. Histological examination showed disrupted elastic laminae without thinning of aortic wall in all samples of aorta. We conclude that polydioxanone suture is a suitable suture material for vascular anastomoses made under tension where growth of the anastomotic site is expected.
