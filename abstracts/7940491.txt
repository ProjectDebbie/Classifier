Sternal closure with resorbable synthetic suture material in children.
The use of resorbable sutures for sternal closure after median sternotomy in children has developed to a clinically routine procedure. Since there is no follow-up study so far about the influence of these synthetic sutures on sternal stability, wound healing, and compatibility in children, we evaluated the use of polydioxanon (PDS) cord in children particularly regarding those properties. In 59 children (weighing up to 30 kg) we could show that the use of synthetic resorbable materials (Vicryl 4/0, PDS) allows a complication-free stability of the sternum, good wound healing, and very good compatibility. It is concluded that the use of PDS cord is a suitable and reliable method for sternal closure with good clinical results.
