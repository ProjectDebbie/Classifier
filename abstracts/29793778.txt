Preforming of polydioxanone sheets for orbital wall fractures - A technical note.
Polydioxanone (PDS) sheets are commonly used in the treatment of orbital wall fractures. AÂ potential drawback of PDS is that it may be difficult to adapt to the anatomy of the orbital walls. Therefore a study was conceived to test the feasibility of preforming PDS sheets. PDS sheet material was water-heated and preformed using a template based on a statistical anatomical model. Then the deformed sheet was cooled, stored and compared to the original model to investigate post-deformation changes. PDS sheet material could easily be deformed using a mould. No significant post-cooling shape changes were noticed. PDS sheet material can be preformed into complex geometric shapes. This could be a benefit in the treatment of orbital wall fractures.
