Single hemicerclage for lateral type B malleolar fracture--a novel, minimal and reliable osteosynthesis.
To investigate the short- and long-term outcome of patients with isolated lateral malleolar fracture type B treated with a single hemicerclage out of metallic wire or PDS cord. Over an 8-year period 97 patients were treated with a single hemicerclage for lateral malleolar fracture type B and 89 were amenable to a follow-up after mean 39 months, including interview, clinical examination and X-ray controls. The median operation time was 35 minutes (range 15-85 min). X-ray controls within the first two postoperative days revealed an anatomical restoration of the upper ankle joint in all but one patient. The complication rate was 8%: hematoma (2 patients), wound infection (2), Sudeck's dystrophy (2) and deep vein thrombosis (1). Full weight-bearing was tolerated at median 6.0 weeks (range 2-26 weeks). No secondary displacement, delayed union or consecutive arthrosis of the upper ankle joint was observed. All but one patient had restored symmetric joint mobility. Ninety-seven percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome. Following bone healing, hemicerclage removal was necessary in 19% of osteosyntheses with metallic wire and in none with PDS cord. The single hemicerclage is a novel, simple and reliable osteosynthesis technique for isolated lateral type B malleolar fractures and may be considered as an alternative to the osteosynthesis procedures currently in use.
