The use of absorbable monofilament polydioxanone suture in pediatric cardiovascular operations.
Growth of suture lines and anastomoses is required for long-term success after the repair of congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Polydioxanone, an absorbable monofilament suture material, has been used in a variety of operations since April, 1983. Twenty-two of the 46 procedures were coarctation repairs. Complete repairs for anomalous pulmonary veins and transposition of the great arteries, as well as Fontan procedures and systemic-pulmonary shunts, have been performed. Angiographic, gross, and microscopic examination showed good healing. There was no anastomotic disruption or aneurysm formation. The results with this absorbable vascular suture have been uniformly encouraging in a follow-up of up to 30 months.
