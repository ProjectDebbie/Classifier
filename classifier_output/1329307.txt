Mechanical properties of suture materials in vitro and after in vivo implantation in horses.
Tensile testing of reproducible loops of size 5 braided polyester, size 2 polyglycolic acid, size 2 monofilament nylon, and size 2 polydioxanone sutures was performed in vitro and after subcutaneous implantation in horses for 7, 14, and 28 days. Maximum breaking strength, energy absorption, and percentage elongation to breakage point were measured. Size 5 braided polyester had the highest maximum breaking strength and energy absorption over 28 days. Polydioxanone had better mechanical performance over 28 days than did polyglycolic acid. On day 28, none of these parameters was measurable in polyglycolic acid. Monofilament nylon had the lowest breaking strength of the three materials tested on day 28.
