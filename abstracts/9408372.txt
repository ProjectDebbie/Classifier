Investigation of microcirculatory changes in the duodenum of dogs caused by surgical suture materials.
Surgical suture materials play an important role in the safe performance of surgical interventions. In our experiments we made an attempt to investigate what microcirculatory changes result from pulling the thread through the wall of the duodenum in Lembert stitches by including 3 kinds of absorbable and non-absorbable suture materials each (Catgut, Dexon, PDS, Silk, Ethibond, Ethilon). Research is still in the pre-experimental stage. In the long run, we hope to enrich the description of these suture materials by some new details. It could help prevent suture insufficiency, facilitate wound healing and thus, improved surgical safety.
