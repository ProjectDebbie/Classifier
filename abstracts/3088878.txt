Polydioxanone in anastomosis of rabbit tubes. A morphological study of the epithelium.
Eight NZW rabbits were submitted to end-to-end tubal anastomosis using polydioxanone (PDS), (Ethicon). The animals were sacrificed at two-week intervals between the second and sixteenth week after operating. The tubes were removed and analysed with the scanning electron microscope for the purpose of studying the morphology of the epithelium. Ciliogenesis was completed between the second and fourth weeks. After this period the epithelial conditions observed were completely normal, except for an abundant mucous secretion which, however, was totally normal after sixteen weeks.
