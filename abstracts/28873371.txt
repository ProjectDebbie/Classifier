Modified Hysterotomy Closure Technique for Open Fetal Surgery.
We reviewed our experience with open fetal surgical myelomeningocele repair to assess the efficacy of a new modification of the hysterotomy closure technique regarding hysterotomy complication rates at the time of cesarean delivery. A modification of the standard hysterotomy closure was performed on all patients undergoing prenatal myelomeningocele repair. The closure consisted of an interrupted full-thickness #0 polydioxanone (PDS) retention suture as well as a running #0 PDS suture to re-approximate the myometrial edges, and the modification was a third imbricating layer resulting in serosal-to-serosal apposition. A standard omental patch was placed per our routine. Both operative reports and verbal descriptions of hysterotomy from delivering obstetricians were reviewed. A total of 49 patients underwent prenatal repair of myelomeningocele, 43 having adequate follow-up for evaluation. Of those, 95.4% had completely intact hysterotomy closures, with only 1 partial dehiscence (2.3%) and 1 thinned scar (2.3%). There were no instances of uterine rupture. In patients undergoing this modified hysterotomy closure technique, a much lower than expected complication rate was observed. This simple modified closure technique may improve hysterotomy healing and reduce obstetric morbidity.
