Effect of the Abdominal Fascial Closure with Triclosan-Coated Sutures in Fecal Peritonitis, on Surgical Site Infection, and Evisceration: A Retrospective Multi-Center Study.
Surgical site infection (SSI) is a frequent complication in dirty surgery, reaching rates of up to 40%. The incidence of SSI might be influenced by the suture used for closure of the abdominal fascia. Sutures coated with antibacterial substances may reduce the bacterial load in the incision. A retrospective study of patients with intra-operative diagnosis of fecal peritonitis undergoing a laparotomy in three Spanish hospitals was performed. Fascial closure consisted in running loop suture of Polyglactin (Vicryl loop<sup>®</sup>, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NY; group 1), running loop suture of triclosan-coated polyglactin (Vicryl plus loop<sup>®</sup>; group 2), running loop suture of polydioxanone (PDS loop<sup>®</sup> Johnson & Johnson; group 3), and running loop suture of triclosan-coated polydioxanone (PDS plus loop<sup>®</sup>; group 4). Incisional SSI and evisceration rates were assessed. One hundred four patients were included. There were no differences in age, gender, comorbidities, etiology of peritonitis, and mortality among groups. Surgical site infection rate was 34.6% in group 1; 8% in group 2; 33% in group 3; and 10% in group 4 (p = 0.029). The use of triclosan-coated sutures is associated with lower risk of SSI (risk ratio [RR]: 9; p = 0.003). Evisceration rate was 0% in groups 1 and 2; 15.2% in group 3; and 10% in group 4 (p = 0.05). All patients suffering from evisceration presented previous SSI. The use of monofilament sutures is associated with higher risk of evisceration (RR: 6.35; p = 0.033). Triclosan-coated sutures reduce SSI rate in fecal peritonitis, without differences between braided and monofilament type. The use of monofilament sutures is related to higher risk of evisceration, independent of a triclosan coating.
