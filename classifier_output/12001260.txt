Biomaterial implants induce the inflammation marker CRP at the site of implantation.
Following implantation of biomaterial patches into the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the host's response towards the foreign material. Asymmetric patches of polydioxanone covered Vicryl or poly-3-hydroxybutyrate were sutured onto the rat stomach. Tissue samples were generated at distinct time intervals after surgery, and RNA profiles were compared by Differential Display. RT-PCR analysis of gene candidates that seemed differentially expressed showed that vitamin D binding protein mRNA was induced in stomach tissue after implantation of the biomaterial patches. In parallel, the amount of C-reactive protein mRNA was found to be increased transiently as well. Implants induce a tissue response that is specific for a given material.
