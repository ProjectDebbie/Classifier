Subcuticular Prolene or PDS for skin closure?
One hundred patients undergoing abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to have their skin wound closed by either polypropylene (Prolene) or polydioxanone (PDS) by the subcuticular method. Ninety-one patients completed the study and were assessed at discharge and again 3 months later for wound complications and cosmetic result. No statistically significant differences were found between the two sutures; overall wound infection rate was 5.5% and cosmetic result was equally acceptable for the two suture materials. This study indicates that an absorbable subcuticular suture may be safely used in all classes of wound.
