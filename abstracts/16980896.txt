Mechanical characteristics of cortical bone pins designed for fracture fixation.
Pins constructed from cortical bone may provide a reasonable alternative to other fracture-fixation devices by circumventing some of the complications associated with stainless steel and synthetic biodegradable implants. However, it is unknown whether cortical bone pins provide comparable strength compared to conventional pins. Using four-point bending, we compared the mechanical characteristics of 1.2-mm allogeneic cortical bone pins milled from specific regions of human tibiae and femora to commercially available 1.1-mm diameter stainless steel pins and 1.3-mm diameter polydioxanone pins. We used impact testing to identify mechanical differences in cortical bone pins between gender and harvest site. Cortical bone pins had better mechanical properties in four-point bending compared with polydioxanone pins, but not stainless steel pins. Pins milled from the right tibiae of males had the best bending characteristics. The mechanical performance of 1.2-mm cortical bone pins was comparable to those of stainless steel and polydioxanone pins regardless of site, bone, and gender. The clinical investigation of cortical bone pins as an implant for fracture fixation is warranted based on mechanical testing and comparison to commercially available polydioxanone and stainless steel pins.
