Use of polydioxanone plate in septal reconstruction.
Septal reconstruction is challenging. Autologous cartilage may be thin or deviated and traditional techniques are often inadequate or technically difficult. The use of an absorbable scaffold material for support during healing can improve results. Polydioxanone (PDS) plate can be used for this purpose. We describe our use of PDS plate in both open and closed septal surgeries, as well as in the repair of septal perforations. Surgical techniques and potential complications are discussed. The current evidence for PDS plate is reviewed. PDS plate is a safe and reliable absorbable implant that has many different applications in septal surgery and reconstruction. It not only acts as a scaffold but also stimulates and guides cartilage regeneration.
