Closure of laparotomy wounds: skin staples versus sutures.
To investigate the routine use of a skin stapling device for the closure of midline abdominal wounds, 48 patients were randomized to receive skin staples or subcuticular polydioxanone sutures. The mean (range) time for closure with staples was 8.0 (3.4-14.8) s cm-1 while subcuticular closure took 12.7 (9.6-28.0) s cm-1. The mean time saved per patient with skin staples was 77 s. Wound pain and requirements for analgesia were significantly lower in the sutured group. The mean cost per patient was 1.41 pounds for subcuticular closure and 7.72 pounds for stapling; the latter also incurred an additional cost of 6.27 pounds for staple removal. No clear benefit derives from the use of staples in the closure of abdominal wounds.
