Foreign body attachment to polypropylene suture material extruded into the small intestinal lumen after enteric closure in three dogs.
Three dogs in which polypropylene suture material was used to close an enteric surgery site in a continuous pattern were evaluated at a later date because of recurrence of signs of intestinal disease. Surgery in each dog revealed that the suture material had been extruded into the lumen of the intestine and acted as a site for attachment of a foreign body. The nonabsorbable nature of polypropylene and its use in a continuous pattern are possible explanations for this complication. Polydioxanone or poliglecaprone 25 may be suitable alternatives to polypropylene for use in a continuous pattern for closure of small intestinal surgery sites.
