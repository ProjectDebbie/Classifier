Tissue restoration after implantation of polyglycolide, polydioxanone, polylevolactide, and metallic pins in cortical bone: an experimental study in rabbits.
We performed qualitative and histoquantitative investigations of tissue restoration after implanting polyglycolide (PGA), polydioxanone (PDS), polylevolactide (PLLA), and stainless steel pins in the intramedullary canal of rabbit femurs. The effect of bioabsorbable devices on healing of a cortical bone defect was also assessed. The cortical bone defect was created in the right femur of 80 rabbits. Bioabsorbable and metallic pins in 60 and two metallic pins alone were implanted in 20 intramedullary canals; 80 left femurs served as intact controls. Follow-up times were 3, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks. At all time points, collagenous connective tissue, including bone trabeculae, surrounded the implant at the tissue-implant interface, replacing hematopoiesis and fat of the intramedullary canal. The groups did not differ in the area and trabecular bone area fraction of the resulting callus. Residual fragments of PGA and PDS were observed at 24 weeks, and complete degradation occurred within 52 weeks. PGA, PDS, PLLA, and metallic implants induced a bony and fibrous walling-off response in the intramedullary cavity. No inflammation was observed. Complete tissue restoration did not occur within the follow-up, even after complete degradation of PGA and PDS, which had shorter degradation times than PLLA. The cortical bone healing effect was not different between bioabsorbable pins and metallic wires. Thus, these polymers had no specific osteostimulatory or osteoinhibitory properties compared to stainless steel. Within the follow-up period, there were no significant differences in biocompatibility between the implants and no adverse inflammatory foreign-body reactions.
