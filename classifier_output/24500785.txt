The use of glass ionomer cement in the reconstructıon of the dorsal L-strut: an experımental study on rabbıts.
This experimental study in a rabbit model aimed to investigate the use of glass ionomer cement as a tissue adhesive on the dorsal L-strut. Sixteen adult male New Zealand White rabbits were used. The rabbits were equally divided into two groups as the control and the study groups. The nasal septum was exposed through a superior approach. A graft was harvested preserving an L-strut cartilage. In the control group, a vertical incision was performed on the dorsal part of the L-strut to divide it into two cut ends, and the graft was sutured to the cut ends with 5-0 polydioxanone suture. In the study group, the reconstruction of the dorsal L-strut was made by fixing the graft to the cut ends with glass ionomer cement as the tissue adhesive. At 2 months, the rabbits were sacrificed. The nasal septum was removed for histopathological examination. No foreign body giant cells or acute inflammation were determined in the rabbits. The study group had less pronounced chronic inflammation. Comparison of the groups revealed that parameters regarding vascularization, cartilage proliferation, and new cartilage cells were statistically significant different between the two groups (P = .010, P = .010, P = .028, respectively). More vascularization, cartilage proliferation, and new cartilage cells were seen in the study group. Glass ionomer cement was effective for the reconstruction of the dorsal L-strut without any foreign body reaction, cartilage necrosis, or marked inflammation in rabbits, and it may be a potentially beneficial alternative to suture fixation.
