Microsurgical use of polydioxanone (PDS) suture: an experimental report.
Although many technological advances have been made in surgical materials, nylon is still the main suture material use for microvascular surgery. This study sought to evaluate polydioxanone (PDS) sutures for use in microvascular anastomoses. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. Spatula-type needles with 9-0 PDS suture were used to anastomose the right femoral arteries, with 9-0 nylon used on the left side. The arteries were observed for 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after surgery to determine arterial patency and to evaluate vascular pathology.  were comparable between PDS and nylon. We suggest that if the suture material is redesigned to allow smooth passage through the tissue, and if the needle used in conjunction with the suture is improved, PDS may offer an excellent material for microvascular anastomosis.
