Surgical treatment of fractures of the distal clavicle with polydioxanone suture tension band wiring: an alternative osteosynthesis.
Fracture of the distal clavicle type II (Neer) is an indication for surgical intervention. We report our experience in 12 patients with acute clavicular fractures and operative treatment with polydioxanone suture (PDS) tension band wiring. The patients were assessed 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively by radiological and clinical evaluation and with the Constant Murley score. All 12 patients had an excellent functional result 12 weeks postoperatively. The Constant Murley score was excellent in all patients. The PDS band can be considered as an alternative osteosynthesis. In the context of the current literature, the advantages and disadvantages of this new procedure are discussed.
