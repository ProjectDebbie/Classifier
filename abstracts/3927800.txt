Comparison of the healing of prescrotal urethrotomy incisions in the dog: sutured versus nonsutured.
Comparison was made of the healing of sutured prescrotal urethral incisions (12 dogs) with that of nonsutured incisions (6 dogs). Comparison was also made of the healing of 5-0 polyglactin 910-sutured urethral incisions (6 dogs) with that of 5-0 polydioxanone-sutured incisions (6 dogs). Three dogs from each treatment group were euthanatized 3 weeks and 6 weeks after the surgical procedure. Surgical sites were examined grossly, and urethral circumference measurements were taken at 3 locations (surgical site, 1 cm cranially, and 1 cm caudally). Transverse sections of the surgical sites were prepared and examined by light microscopy. Hemorrhage occurred postoperatively in dogs in which the incisions were not sutured. The surgical sites from the 6 dogs in which incisions healed by second intention had more fibrosis and less inflammation than did those that were sutured. There was little difference between incisions sutured with polyglactin 910 and those sutured with polydioxanone suture material. Postoperative urethral stricture formation did not occur in any of the dogs.
