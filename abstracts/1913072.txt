Imaging properties of polydioxanone and titanium ligating clips following para-aortic lymphadenectomy for testicular cancer.
Stainless steel ligating clips produce serious artefacts on CT scans. Polydioxanone (PDS) and titanium ligating clips were used in 15 patients during para-aortic lymphadenectomy for residual metastatic testicular teratoma following chemotherapy, and follow-up CT images were compared with those following the use of stainless steel ligating clips. PDS ligating clips did not produce any artefacts and were progressively absorbed. Titanium ligating clips produced artefacts similar to but less intense than those of stainless steel. PDS ligating clips should be used when follow-up CT scanning is important.
