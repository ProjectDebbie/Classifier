PDS (polydioxanone suture): a new synthetic absorbable suture in cataract surgery. A preliminary study.
PDS (polydioxanone suture), a new synthetic absorbable suture, was used in 21 patients undergoing cataract surgery. It still retains 25% of its tensile strength at 42 days but absorption takes 130-180 days. 1 braided coated and 1 monofilament PDS were adequate as conjunctival sutures but offered no advantage over available materials. 0.5 monofilament PDS was superior in handling qualities to 0.4 virgin silk. It does not need to be removed but retains tensile strength for longer than other absorbable sutures.
