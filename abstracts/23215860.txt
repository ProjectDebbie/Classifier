A biomechanical study of laparoscopic 4S-modified Roeder and Weston knot strength in 3-0 polyglactin 910 and 3-0 polydioxanone.
To (1) evaluate biomechanical strength of 4 different laparoscopic knots using 2 suture types, and (2) evaluate carotid artery ligature bursting pressure of 2 knots using a single suture type. Biomechanical materials testing. Suture material (3-0 polydioxanone, 3-0 polyglactin 910). Four knot types were tested: 4S-modified Roeder (4SMR) Weston plus 3 square throws (W3S); Weston plus 3 granny throws (W3G); and a 4 square throw knot as a control (control); 24 specimens of each knot type were tied with 3-0 polyglactin 910 and 24 of 3 knot types (4SMR, W3S, control) were tied with 3-0 polydioxanone. Suture loop constructs were tested to 3 mm displacement failure and ultimate failure. Carotid artery ligation bursting pressure was tested using 10 samples each of 4SMR and W3S knots with 3-0 polyglactin 910. The W3S, W3G, and controls were similar. The 4SMR was similar to W3S using 3-0 PDS but the 4SMR had lower load to failure and greater elongation than the Weston using 3-0 polyglactin 910. The 4SMR had a higher slippage rate with 3-0 polyglactin 910. All ligatures withstood supraphysiologic pressures. Surgeons using 3-0 polyglactin 910 should consider using the Weston knot with added throws during laparoscopic procedures.
