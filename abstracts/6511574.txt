Surgical implantation of radiotelemetry devices in American river otters.
The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation elected to investigate the feasibility of reintroducing American river otters (Lutra canadensis) into Oklahoma waterways. Intra-abdominal radiotelemetry devices were selected to monitor otter movements following release. For implantation of those devices, the anesthetic regimen included a mixture of ketamine HCl, xylazine, and acepromazine maleate given intramuscularly followed by delivery of isoflurane through precision vaporizers. A ventral midline approach and adherent surgical barrier drapes facilitated aseptic placement of the devices, with minimal tissue damage and loss of insulating pelage. Absorbable monofilament suture (polydioxanone) was used in a buried 3-layer closure of surgical incisions. The incisions healed rapidly and without complications.
