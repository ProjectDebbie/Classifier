Absorbable pulmonary artery banding: a strategy for reducing reoperations.
Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) remains in the armamentarium of techniques for several congenital cardiac anomalies, but necessitates a reoperation for eventual removal. We sought to assess the efficacy of an absorbable PAB in obviating the requirement for reoperation. From 2003 to 2015, 45 consecutive patients with a median age of 1.6 months (2 days-11 months) underwent placement of a polydioxanone absorbable PAB. In 28 patients (62%), the band was placed concomitantly to a ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure and in 17 (38%), the band was the sole procedure for the VSDs. Fourteen patients had additional cardiac anomalies and 9 patients had aortic arch anomalies, which were repaired at the time of absorbable PAB placement. There was 1 hospital death. The band was removed early in 3 patients. Mean time to follow-up was 5.2 ± 3.5 years. Overall, 32 of the 41 patients discharged from hospital with absorbable PABs did not require reoperation on the VSDs or the band, resulting in a single-stage definitive repair of 78%. Median time to absorbable PAB resorption was 7.2 months (interquartile range, 5.0-10.4). Freedom from reoperation related to residual VSDs or PAB obstruction was 78% (95% CI: 61-87%) at 10 years. The use of absorbable polydioxanone PABs is an effective method of reducing reoperations for multiple VSDs. Their use should be incorporated in the surgical strategy for repair of muscular and residual VSDs.
