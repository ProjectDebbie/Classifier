Characterization of the inhibition of vein graft intimal hyperplasia by a biodegradable vascular stent.
Characterization of biodegradable stent vein graft thickening. Polydioxanone vascular sutures (PDSs) were used in a biodegradable arteriovenous bypass model. Twenty-four rabbits underwent carotid interposition bypass via ipsilateral jugular vein. One half received the stent (PDS group) and the remaining half a simple vein graft (controls). Group subsets received external stent removal or sham-control exploration at 4 and 12 weeks. At 4 and 12 weeks, the PDS group had significantly less medial and intimal thickening than the control group (P < 0.05), and there were fewer proliferating smooth muscle cells and extra cellular matrix formation than the control group at every interval. At 12 weeks, partial stent degradation occurred without deleterious effects. Furthermore proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) levels were significantly lower than the control group. The external stent inhibited medial and intimal hyperplasia, an effect that remains after the material has completely degraded. This PDS stent is feasible option for vein grafts.
