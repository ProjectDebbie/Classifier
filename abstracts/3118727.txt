Mechanical performance of monofilament synthetic absorbable sutures.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mechanical performance of two new synthetic monofilament absorbable sutures. The polydioxanone sutures is prepared by polymerizing and extruding the monomer, paradioxanone, in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The other suture is a modified polyglycolic acid suture, made by reacting trimethylene carbonate and glycolide. The knot configuration (1 = 1 = 1, 1 x 1 x 1, and 2 = 1 = 1) required for knot security was identical for the two synthetic monofilament sutures. The mean knot breaking strengths for the polydioxanone and modified polyglycolic acid sutures did not differ significantly. The surfaces of these sutures exhibited a low coefficient of friction which was slightly increased by hydration. The most distinctive difference between the handling characteristics of these two sutures was their flexural rigidity. The stiffness of the polydioxanone suture was 60 percent greater than that of the modified polyglycolic acid suture.
