Tissue reactions to absorbable ligating clips.
Scanning electron microscopy was used in a comparative ultrastructural study of biodegradable ligating clips, the Absolok (polydioxanone) and the Lactomer (copolymer of glycolic and lactic acids), implanted subcutaneously in rabbits. The inflammatory response and tissue reactions to the implanted clips and their effects on clip breakdown were studied. By the first week after implantation, numerous inflammatory cells adhered to the clip surfaces, with occasional fibroblasts present. By two weeks after implantation there was a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells, but the number of fibroblasts gradually increased, resulting in encapsulation of the clips. The thickness of the fibrous tissue capsule, formed by a variety of collagen fibers, gradually increased 5-25 weeks after implantation. Residues from the Lactomer clips were still present within the encapsulating tissue at 25 weeks. In contrast, clips enclosed in nylon pouches were totally degraded, and no residues were detectable at 25 weeks. Tissue reactions similar to those observed for nonpouched implanted clips were seen over the entire external surface of the pouches.
