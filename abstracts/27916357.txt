Triclosan sutures for surgical site infection in colorectal cancer.
Among all procedures, surgical site infections (SSIs) in colorectal surgery continue to have the highest rate, accounting for 5%-45%. To prevent the bacterial colonization of suture material, which disables local mechanisms of wound decontamination, triclosan-coated sutures were developed. We assessed the effectiveness of triclosan-coated sutures used for skin closure on the rate of SSIs in colorectal cancer surgery. Until August 2012, we used conventional methods for skin closure in colorectal cancer surgery at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine. Therefore, for the control group, we retrospectively collected surveillance data over a 1.5-y period. From September 2012, we began using triclosan-coated polydioxanone antimicrobial sutures (PDS plus) for skin and fascia closure. Hence, we collected data for the study group from September 2012 to October 2013. Differences in baseline characteristics and selection bias were adjusted using the propensity score-matching method. A total of 399 patients who underwent colorectal surgery were included in this study. There were 214 patients in the control group and 185 patients in the study group. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the propensity score-matched groups. The incidence of SSIs was less in the study group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the site of the procedure, laparoscopic surgery, and using triclosan-coated sutures remained the independent predictors of SSIs. The use of triclosan-coated sutures was advantageous for decreasing the risk of SSIs after colorectal surgery.
