Arterial regeneration over polydioxanone prostheses in the rabbit.
We analyzed histologic, ultrastructural, and functional characteristics of rabbit aortic conduits regenerated over absorbable polydioxanone prostheses. Twenty-eight polydioxanone-elicited prosthesis/tissue complexes harvested two weeks to 12 months following implantation were analyzed grossly; photographed; sectioned for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy; and studied for compliance, bursting strength, and prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolite contents. No aortic-related deaths or hemorrhages occurred. Smooth regenerated conduits without stenoses were seen in 27 of 28 specimens, with one small aneurysm. Transprosthetic myofibroblast migration and proliferation paralleled the kinetics of macrophage-mediated prosthetic dissolution, which was consequently delayed compared with polyglycolic acid prostheses. Confluent endothelial-like luminal surfaces were present after two weeks. Progressive inner capsular thickening ended after three months at 420 micron. Ex vivo compliance curves resembled arterial elasticity. Regenerated tissue withstood 1200 mm Hg of systolic pressure, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha to thromboxane B2 ratios did not differ from normal control specimens.
