Experimental studies with absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures in infected canine arterial anastomoses.
Vascular anastomoses are usually performed with nonabsorbable synthetic suture material. In an infected wound suture material may have a negative effect on the healing of vascular anastomoses, leading to leakage and formation of false aneurysms. In a canine model 40 neck wounds and 40 groin wounds were contaminated with a standard suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequently 80 end-to-end anastomoses were performed in both carotid and femoral arteries with the absorbable polydioxanone (PDS) or the nonabsorbable polypropylene (PPL) suture material in one of either side. After wound infection or hemorrhage occurred, or at least 7 days to 6 months after vascular surgery, the dogs were put to death and the contaminated vessels were removed to determine the extent of infection with light and scanning electron microscopy. Macroscopic (presence of pus, anastomotic rupture, or aneurysm) and microscopic findings (absorption, tissue reaction) were compared statistically with the McNemar test. There was no difference in the incidence of wound infection between the sutures examined. Bacteriologic cultures revealed no other microorganism than the inoculated staphylococcus strain or occasional skin contaminants. In the PPL group hemorrhages occurred more frequently (n = 6) than in the PDS group (n = 2; p = 0.125). Anastomotic aneurysms (n = 5) were found only in the PPL group (p = 0.375). These differences, although statistically not significant (because of the small number of the studied anastomoses), suggest the use of monofilament absorbable suture material for autogenous anastomoses in a contaminated area.
